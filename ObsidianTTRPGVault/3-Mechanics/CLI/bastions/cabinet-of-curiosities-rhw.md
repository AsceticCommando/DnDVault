# Cabinet of Curiosities
*Level 9 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Cramped (4 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: trade

A Cabinet of Curiosities is a small salon, closet space, or antechamber where you can keep and catalog peculiar objects and fascinating oddities.

## Trade: Acquire Curios

When you issue the Trade order to this facility, you supply this facility's hireling with a certain amount of gold and commission them to purchase strange items from unusual sources. It takes 28 days for the hireling to return to the Bastion with one or more magic items for you. Your investment determines the rarity of these items, and the quantity of magic items depends on the number of Haunted special facilities in your Bastion at the time of the hireling's return, as shown on the Curio Investment and Curios Collected tables.

**Curio Investment**

| Investment | Item Rarity |
|------------|-------------|
| 150 GP | Common |
| 600 GP | Uncommon |
| 6,000 GP | Rare |
| 60,000 GP | Very Rare |

**Curios Collected**

| Haunted Facilities | Magic Items Acquired | Cursed Item Chance (1d100) |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 0 | 1 | — |
| 1–2 | `dice:1d2\|noform\|noparens\|avg\|text(1–2)` (`1d2`) (flip a coin) | 01–10 |
| 3–5 | `dice:1d3\|noform\|noparens\|avg\|text(1d3)` | 01–20 |
| 6 | `dice:1d4\|noform\|noparens\|avg\|text(1d4)` | 01–25 |
^curios-collected

To determine how many magic items your hireling brings back, count the Haunted special facilities in your Bastion, then roll the die indicated in the Magic Items Acquired column on the Curios Collected table. The DM rolls on the Cursed Item Chance (`dice:1d100|noform|noparens|avg` (`1d100`)) column to determine whether one of the magic items carries a curse. The DM chooses which item is cursed and establishes the nature of the curse.

For each magic item acquired, roll on a table in the ""Random Magic Items"" section in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" of the corresponding rarity to determine what the item is. (Select the treasure theme randomly.)
