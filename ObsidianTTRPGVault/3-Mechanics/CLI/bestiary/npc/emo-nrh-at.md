  - "desc": "Emo shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll\
      \ duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:\n\
      \n- **1. Happiness Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom\
      \ saving throw or fall [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) with\
      \ laughter, becoming [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ and unable to stand up for 1 minute or until Emo harms the creature. The target\
      \ can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect\
      \ on itself on a success.  \n- **2. Sadness Ray.** The targeted creature must\
      \ succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target\
      \ is overcome by sorrow and takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can't take a reaction\
      \ until the end of its next turn. On its next turn, it can use either an action\
      \ or a bonus action, not both. On a successful save, the target takes half as\
      \ much damage and suffers none of the other effects.  \n- **3. Anger Ray.**\
      \ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled\
      \ to duel with Emo for 1 minute. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls\
      \ against creatures other than Emo and must make a Wisdom saving throw each\
      \ time it attempts to move more than 30 feet away from Emo.  \n- **4. Anxiety\
      \ Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw\
      \ or lose the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures\
      \ it can see as enemies for 1 minute. Each time the target takes damage, it\
      \ can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n\
      \n    Whenever the affected creature targets another creature with an attack,\
      \ spell, or other ability, it must choose the target at random from among the\
      \ creatures it can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it's\
      \ using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature,\
      \ the creature must make that attack if it is able to.  \n- **5. Fear Ray.**\
      \ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
      \ for 1 minute.  \n\n    The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of\
      \ each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **6. Desolation\
      \ Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw.\
      \ On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell\
      \ ends. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage and perceives\
      \ itself to be confined within an illusory stone cell for 1 minute. The target\
      \ can't see or hear anything beyond the cell and is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
      \  \n- **7. Jealousy Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom\
      \ saving throw or become [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ for 1 minute. While the target is [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ in this way, it must use its action before moving on each of its turns to\
      \ make a melee attack against a creature that Emo chooses. The target can repeat\
      \ the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself\
      \ on a success.  \n- **8. Disgusting Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed\
      \ on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the\
      \ target is enveloped in sphere of yellow, nauseating gas and spends its action\
      \ on its next turn retching and reeling.  \n- **9. Surprise Ray.** The targeted\
      \ creature must succeed on a  \n\n    DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded)\
      \ by a spray of color until the end of its next turn.  \n- **10. Trust Ray.**\
      \ The targeted creature must succeed on a  \n\n    DC 16 Wisdom saving throw\
      \ or be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by Emo for 1\
      \ hour or until Emo harms the creature.  "
