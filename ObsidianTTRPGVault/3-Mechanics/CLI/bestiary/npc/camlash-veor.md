*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 181*  

Camlash is a monstrous demon covered in countless tiny, crawling spiders that appear and disappear at random.

Lolth isn't present in Pandesmos; she has given command of her legions to Camlash. The balor general specializes in leading campaigns with troops of loyal driders and mutated arachnids. Adherents of Lolth have joined Camlash's forces, despite the usual animosity between driders and people. All fight together in Lolth's name.
