# [The Gardener](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 200*  

The Gardener is an archfey who adores the splendor of nature, the joy of song, and the glow of shared merriment. This ancient being once wandered the Feywild and worlds of the Material Plane until two dear friends created a wondrous garden and asked the Gardener to tend to it. The Gardener agreed to the request, then pulled the garden from the Material Plane and transformed it into a Domain of Delight—a region of the Feywild that bows to an archfey's will. This place became known as the Eternal Garden.

The Gardener abhors bloodshed and avoids killing even those who threaten the garden, preferring to entangle them in vines and pacify them with tranquilizing breaths of flowery mist.

## The Gardener's Lair

The Gardener's lair is the entirety of the Eternal Garden.

      \ to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of any other Medium or larger plant within\
      \ the lair.  \n- **Vine Wall.** A wall of grasping vines appears on the ground\
      \ within 120 feet of the Gardener. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high,\
      \ and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each\
      \ creature in its area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have\

      \ when it starts its turn inside the wall or when it enters the wall for the\
      \ first time on a turn. The wall's area is difficult terrain for a creature\
      \ that isn't grappled. The wall sinks back into the ground, freeing all creatures\
      \ grappled by it, when the Gardener uses this lair action again or when the\
      \ Gardener dies.  "

  - "desc": "The Eternal Garden has the following features:\n\n- **Boundary.** At\
      \ the border of the domain is a lightly obscuring mist, tinged with a sweet\
      \ blossom scent and the colors of sunset. No matter how far a creature travels\
      \ into the mist, the creature finds itself back where it entered the border,\
      \ returning to the garden.  \n- **Eternal Summer.** The climate in the garden\
      \ is a perpetual, lovely summer, but weather conditions reflect the emotional\
      \ tone of creatures in the garden. In times of danger, thunderstorms shake the\
      \ sky. During times of melancholy or mourning, chill rain patters throughout\
      \ the domain.  \n- **Gardener's Vigil.** The Gardener senses when anything dies\
      \ in the garden. If a creature dies in the garden, roll a d6. On a 1, the Gardener\
      \ appears on initiative count 20 of the next round (losing initiative ties)\
      \ to investigate.  \n- **Lighting.** The sky above the garden is a perpetual\
      \ twilight range of orange, red, pink, and yellow hues with no visible sun,\
      \ moon, or stars. During daylight hours, it emits bright light, but at night,\
      \ it never reaches full darkness, becoming dim light instead.  \n- **Memory\
      \ Loss.** Unless otherwise stated, a creature that leaves the domain must make\
      \ a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw; Fey creatures and creatures with the Fey Ancestry\
      \ trait automatically succeed on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\
      \ remembers nothing of its time in the garden or the Palace of Spires. On a\
      \ successful save, the creature's memories remain intact, but they're hazy and\
      \ dreamlike. A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell restores the creature's\
      \ memories.  \n- **Time.** Time passes slower in the Eternal Garden relative\
      \ to other planes. For each day spent in the garden, one year passes on the\
      \ Material Plane.  "
