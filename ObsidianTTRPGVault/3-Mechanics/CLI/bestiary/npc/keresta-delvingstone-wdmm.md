# [Keresta Delvingstone](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/keresta-delvingstone-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 232*  

Keresta Delvingstone grew up in the streets of Waterdeep and is no stranger to hardship. Hoping to make a better life for herself, she became an adventurer and sought fame and fortune in Undermountain. Keresta met her end in the lair of a vampire and became a vampire spawn under its command.

After Vanrak destroyed the vampire and conquered its lair, he took Keresta under his wing. Consumed by darkness and loss, Keresta was drawn to Shar like a moth to a flame and rose to become a vampire cleric of the evil god. She now leads Shar's debased cult in Vanrakdoom and intends to send the group on a mission to destroy the Spires of the Morning, the temple of Lathander (god of birth and renewal) in Waterdeep. She also has her sights set on destroying the House of the Moon—Waterdeep's temple of Selûne, whom she blames for the destruction of Vanrak Moonstar.
