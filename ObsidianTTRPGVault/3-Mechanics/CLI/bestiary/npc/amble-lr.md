      \ or less, and can remain in this form for up to 6 hours. Amble's equipment\
      \ melds with their new form. Amble reverts to their true form if they die or\
      \ fall [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). Amble\
      \ can revert to their true form using a bonus action on their turn.\n\nAmble's\
      \ game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but they retain\
      \ their alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.\
      \ Amble also retains all their skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition\
      \ to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency\
      \ as Amble and the bonus in its stat block is higher, use the creature's bonus\
      \ instead of Amble's.\n\nWhen Amble transforms, they assume the beast's hit\
      \ points and Hit Dice. When Amble reverts to their normal form, they return\
      \ to the number of hit points they had before they transformed. However, if\
      \ Amble reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries\
      \ over their normal form.\n\nAmble can't cast spells, and their ability to speak\
      \ or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of their\
      \ beast form. Transforming doesn't break Amble's [concentration](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\

      \ that are part of a spell."
