# [Chakuna](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/chakuna-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 174*  

Chakuna is Valachan's deadliest hunter, a youthful werepanther with the intensity and calm of a veteran executioner. Few can elude her cold cunning, deadly traps, and packs of feline allies.

Chakuna is no mere murderer. She hunts because she must to protect the people of Oselo from a more terrible fate. To that end, she prefers to target strangers in her land, forcing them to participate in the Trial of Hearts. She relishes the chance to hunt the proud and disrespectful, as well as the skilled and unpredictable. Chakuna knows no mercy, though, and even those she comes to respect eventually face her blade. She spares the people of Oselo alone, even as her peoples' fear of her grows.
