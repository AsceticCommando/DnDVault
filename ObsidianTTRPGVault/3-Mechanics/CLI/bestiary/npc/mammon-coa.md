# [Mammon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/mammon-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 230*  

Perhaps the richest being in all the realms, there is nothing that Mammon loves more than wealth. Where other devils obsess over souls and power, Mammon is perfectly content to continually increase his material possessions. Interestingly, he is one of the only archdevils willing to make deals with mortals over strictly monetary terms. Whether he maintains his end of the deal, however, is a completely different story. Anyone that interacts with Mammon immediately recognizes his two-faced approach—the devil will say or do anything, if he thinks it will benefit him in the end.

Aside from hunting for coin, Mammon also enjoys hunting for sport. If anger strikes him (and it does so often), he will frequently summon up a steed and hounds to partake in a trophy hunt.

Anything he has designated as prey rarely escapes his fervor, though he quickly grows bored once his quarry is caught.

Scheming and betrayal are like breathing for Mammon, and conversely so is bootlicking. Some argue that his punishment after the Reckoning was severely reduced due to his shameless groveling before Asmodeus. In fact, he was the first of all archdevils to surrender during the coup, even selling out some of his co-conspirators.

Despite all his faults, one thing Mammon has mastered is the soul trade. Even Asmodeus recognizes that no archdevil can manage and distribute souls as well as Mammon. Perhaps his expertise comes from the massive profit that can be made from managing souls, or perhaps he wanted to find somewhere to belong—nobody knows for sure.

## Mammon's Lair

Mammon's lair is in a tomb-like palace, within Minauros, and like most structures in the city is in a perpetual state of sinking into the swamp.
