# [Thurl Merosska](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/thurl-merosska-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 192*  

Thurl Merosska is the leader of the Feathergale Knights. Once a griffon rider of Waterdeep, Thurl retired after a storm nearly claimed his life. Obsessed with his near-death experience, Thurl learned of Yan-C-Bin and swore an oath to serve the elemental prince in exchange for power.

Thurl realized that there were others among the wealthy of Waterdeep who might make worthy servants of Yan-C-Bin. He formed the Feathergale Society to lure likely individuals into the air cult. He indoctrinated his Feathergale knights, one by one, into the cult's beliefs.

When Aerisi Kalinoth arose as the chosen prophet of air, Thurl reluctantly pledged the Feathergale Knights to the cause. He resents Aerisi Kalinoth's rulership of the cult, but tells himself that he can use her and her followers to make the Feathergale Society strong enough to rule Waterdeep as it should be ruled.
