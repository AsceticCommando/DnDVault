# [Hazlik](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/hazlik-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 98*  

The paranoid, egomaniacal archmage Hazlik clings to his power despite his magical ambitions being supernaturally smothered. Since Hazlik entered Hazlan, his magic has become unstable. Spells he casts behave erratically and fade swiftly—most lasting no more than an hour—while his magical creations fall apart in about a day. The idea of others learning this terrifies the Darklord, which leads him to claim others' works as his own, spy on potential rivals, and order reckless research into the nature of magic and his domain.

Hazlik suffers vivid nightmares wherein past rivals taunt and torment him. The Darklord avoids sleeping, employing magical tinctures to stay awake, but this causes him to vacillate between bouts of exhaustion, jitters, and paranoia.

Hazlik knows that his domain is being ripped apart by magical disasters—many of his own creation. He openly denies the realm's devastation, though, his fear of cascading ruin clashing with his inability to admit he's wrong.
