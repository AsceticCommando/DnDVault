# [Ebonbane](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ebonbane-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 150*  

*Ebonbane*is an evil, sapient blade that seeks to annihilate the legacy of the Shadowlands' greatest hero and her allies. This includes all with the Shadowborn name and every member of the Circle. Ebonbane is a magic weapon, but within Shadowborn Manor, it becomes a creature that can move on its own. Beyond the manor, it doesn't use its stat block—it requires a wielder to work its evil in the world.

Many who attempt to attune to the weapon are slain outright by its evil. Those who do manage to wield*Ebonbane*must endure the Darklord's constant demands and risk becoming its pawn (see " Sentient Magic Items " in the Dungeon Master's Guide). If unattended outside Shadowborn Manor,*Ebonbane*eventually finds its way back there. No one can carry*Ebonbane*out of the Shadowlands. If someone tries, the sword vanishes and reappears in Shadowborn Manor.*Ebonbane*has a flamboyant personality and a penchant for the dramatic and sadistic. It has no regard for life and delights in animating the corpses of foes, then destroying them in front of their allies. When it speaks, it uses language that mocks the elevated speech of knights.
