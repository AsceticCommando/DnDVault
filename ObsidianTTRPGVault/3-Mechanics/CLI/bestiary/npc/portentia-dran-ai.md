# [Portentia Dran](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/portentia-dran-ai.md)
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 208*  

Now the owner and driving force behind Dran Enterprises-perhaps Acquisitions Incorporated's most notable rival in the adventuring-for-profit-and-power biz—Portentia Dran is more than she appears to be. Quite literally. The person known as Portentia is actually a changeling, who took the place of the real Portentia before her fifth year.

The changeling Portentia can affect a range of dis guises, and has spent long years engaged in a mission of manipulating the members of the Dran family. Years ago, it was Portentia who tricked her sister Auspicia into exploring the depths of the Wandering Crypt. And she would have been successful in arranging for Omin to be claimed by that creature as well if he hadn't fled immediately in search of a weapon to aid his captured sister.

Whether in combat or social encounters, Portentia shifts frequently between different forms and mindsets, only some of which are fully humanoid. She fights to maim, with a cruel combat style that emphasizes surprise and painful instruction. She is willing to affect any appearance or attitude to achieve her goals. But what those goals are-for herself and Dran Enterprises alike-remain a secret known only to her.
