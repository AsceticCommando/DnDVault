# [Jarad Vod Savo](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jarad-vod-savo-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 235*  

The Golgari guildmaster is a Devkarin necromancer and lich named Jarad Vod Savo. In life, Jarad was an archer and accomplished hunter, as well as the brother of the previous guildmaster, the ambitious Savra. Jarad mastered the ways of necromancy so he could rise as a lich after he sacrificed himself to save his son from the demon Rakdos.

As head of the Golgari Swarm, Jarad commands elf and medusa assassins, legions of kraul, brutish trolls, and masses of undercity-dwelling creatures. Thanks to the necromantic power he wields-and with the support of his loyal guards and soldiers-he has survived a number of assassination attempts from various upstarts.

## Undead Nature

Jarad doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
