      \ interacted with her specifically.  \n- Burney is under the effect of a permanent\
      \ [mind blank](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mind-blank-xphb.md) spell, and cannot\
      \ be detected by magical or mundane means unless she wishes it. In exchange\
      \ for this blessing, Burney can take no direct action against the denizens of\
      \ the Nine Hells, though she can certainly enlist the help of those who can.\
      \  \n- Burney always knows the location of the Wandering Emporium and can transport\
      \ herself there as though by a [word of recall](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/word-of-recall-xphb.md)\
      \ spell. This explains why Burney simply seems to appear amid the fully deployed\
      \ marketplace each morning it is active to provide service and tell stories.\
      \  \n- Once each day, when Burney so desires, she can instantly transport herself\
      \ to the court of Bahamut via a powerful blessing akin to the [plane shift](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift-xphb.md)\
      \ spell.  "
