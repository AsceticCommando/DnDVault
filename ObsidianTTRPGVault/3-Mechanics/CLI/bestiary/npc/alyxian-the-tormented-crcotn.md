"lair_actions":
  - "desc": "On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Alyxian can take one\
      \ of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds\
      \ in a row:\n\n- **Avandra's Grasp.** Alyxian uses the power of Avandra's ruined\
      \ temple (area H2) to create a watery tendril that rises out of the lake. One\
      \ creature Alyxian can see that's not submerged in the lake must succeed on\
      \ a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by the tendril. The tendril is a Large object that has AC 10, 15 hit points,\
      \ and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The tendril disappears when it\
      \ is reduced to 0 hit points or the next time Alyxian takes a lair action. \
      \ \n- **Corellon's Charm.** Alyxian causes a magical wisp of light to emerge\
      \ from Corellon's ruined temple (area H3). The wisp enters the body of one creature\
      \ Alyxian can see that isn't inside Corellon's ruined temple or atop the rocky\
      \ island that supports it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving\
      \ throw or be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by Alyxian\
      \ until initiative count 20 of the next round.  \n- **Sehanine's Torment.**\
      \ Alyxian uses the power of Sehanine's ruined temple (area H4) to create a watery\
      \ form in the space of one creature that is either standing on the lake or submerged\
      \ in it. The watery form assumes the vague likeness of the creature whose space\
      \ it occupies and makes one melee weapon attack (+7 to hit) against it. On a\
      \ hit, the attack deals 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Whether it hits or misses,\
      \ the watery form disappears after making its attack.  \n\n**Prayers to the\
      \ Gods.** A character can use an action to pray to Avandra, Corellon, or Sehanine\
      \ in the deity's prayer site. The character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Religion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion))\
      \ check, and the check has advantage if the character is a worshiper of that\
      \ god. On a successful check, the profane ruins atop the island melt away, and\
      \ Alyxian can no longer use the lair action associated with that prayer site.\
      \ In addition, Alyxian takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage, regardless of his current\
      \ form."

      \ that area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. The effect\
      \ lasts until the end of Alyxian's next turn, when the weapons return to Alyxian\
      \ and embed themselves in his hide once again (causing him no harm)."
