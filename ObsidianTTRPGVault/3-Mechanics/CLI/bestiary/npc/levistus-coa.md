# [Levistus](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 229*  

No archdevil is more hated than the Frozen Prince, Levistus, despite his reputation as an honorable and chivalrous archdevil. Rivaling Asmodeus and Dis in their ability to plan and strategize, Levistus is generally considered one of the most plausible archdevils for overthrowing the throne. His ambition was somewhat stifled when he committed an unspeakable betrayal and was imprisoned by Asmodeus deep within the ice of Stygia.

Even while imprisoned, Levistus continues to plot, choosing to force his rage inward and reflect. Divination and communication magic helps aid this effort, and even from within his icy tomb Levistus manages legions. Levistus is known to make many deals with adventurers, provided they can aid his search for freedom.

When the Reckoning happened. Asmodeus, noticing that Levistus played no part in the war, chose to reinstate him as ruler of Stygia. While Levistus still desired revenge on his jailor, he recognized the opportunity and pledged temporary allegiance to Asmodeus. Publicly, Levistus completely supports Asmodeus and his plans, though from beneath the ice he continues to plot his revenge.

Other archdevils describe Levistus as clever, charming, and observant, if not also traitorous. He was often known to engage adversaries in single combat, only calling upon his magic and followers if someone or something intervened. For this reason, he is often worshipped by honorable thieves and charlatans—rogues with a code.

Levistus is described as an attractive humanoid male, with dark hair, an impeccable goatee, and pale-white skin.

## Levistus' Lair

The ruler of Stygia's lair is within his floating prison. This great glacier moves ponderously over the ages, carrying with it Levistus, and the effects of his lair.
