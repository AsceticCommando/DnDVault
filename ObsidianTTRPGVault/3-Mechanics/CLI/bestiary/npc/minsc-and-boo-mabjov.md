# [Minsc and Boo!](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/minsc-and-boo-mabjov.md)
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy p. 68*  

Minsc is a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen in the utter east, though his affinity for animals speaks to his skill as a hunter and tracker as well. He originally came to the Sword Coast on a dejemma, a ritual journey to manhood, as the bodyguard of a young Wychalarn of Rashemen named Dynaheir. But Dynaheir was killed while Minsc was adventuring with the Bhaalspawn known as Abdel Adrian.

Minsc continued his adventures with Abdel until he had the misfortune of being [petrified](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) by an evil wizard. He remained a [petrified](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) statue for nearly a century before another wizard released him. Everyone and everything that he had known had passed on, so Minsc decided not to return to Rashemen, but continue his adventures on the Sword Coast. During those adventures he met Suldil. He felt an affinity for the woman due to the fact that they both lost centuries of their lives to magic. When he has time away from his other adventures, Minsc helps track down prospective heroes who Suldil thinks might make good members of the Knights of Bahamut. Minsc secretly hopes that she will one day think that Boo will make a good member of the Knights of Bahamut.

Minsc does not have a strong hold on reality, as evidenced by his continued dependence on his animal companion Boo, a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster. Apparently such things do exist somewhere in the Realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head. Minsc has a very simplistic view of the world and is often quick to decide whether or not someone is evil and should be attacked. Fortunately, he is also kind by nature and determined to be a hero. He is somewhat unstable and is prone to flying into a rage.

## Minsc as a Contact

Minsc is the primary contact for members of the Knights of Bahamut at low levels. He is able to convince strange companions to join you in your adventures. Your group can only have one such companion at a time.
