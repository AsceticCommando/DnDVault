# [Ankhtepot](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ankhtepot-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 88*  

Ankhtepot has known treachery and conquest. He has known divinity and rule. But now he knows simply boredom and despair. He desires only to recover his lost ka, which he knows lies hidden in Har'Akir. With it, he hopes to become mortal again, die, and face his gods' judgment. Whether this means peace or oblivion matters not to him. Ankhtepot seeks only an end, and he and his followers will be a plague on Har'Akir until he finds it.
