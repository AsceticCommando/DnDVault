# [Flimp Shagglecran](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/flimp-shagglecran-mabjov.md)
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy p. 32*  

Flimpius Theodore Shagglecran (known to his friends as Flimp) is a gnome artificer who hails from the island nation of Lantan. Flimp has an appearance unlike any other gnome on Faerûn. Dressed in plate armor with hooks and pouches for keeping his many inventions, Flimp is always accompanied by his ornery, but entirely mechanical, dog named Metallison.

Flimp spent his youth as many gnomes in Lantan do—studying with hopes to one day join the Gnomish Academy of Engineering. While he easily qualified to study at the Academy, Flimp quickly found that such a life was too boring for his tastes. To the consternation of his family and teachers, Flimp set off on a merchant ship headed north to the fabled city of Waterdeep. Halfway into the voyage, his ship was struck by misfortune and swamped during a powerful storm. Flimp found himself shipwrecked on a strange land with only a few other survivors with him. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, for it was how he met his great friend and ally, the Waterdhavian scholar Doc Watson.

Together the two of them were able to rebuild and modify the wrecked ship which they named the Kraken's Folly. The name was inspired by the ship's most unique addition, a magical steering wheel (stolen from the lair of a kraken) that allows the ship to sail between worlds. After convincing Doc Watson to give up academic life, the two new friends used the ship to launch an adventuring career. This career turned out to be so lucrative, that eventually they founded a joint venture they named "The Adventurer's Guild".

## Flimp as a Contact

Flimp is the primary contact for members of the Adventurer's Guild at low levels. Flimp can use his planar ship, the Kraken's Folly, to take adventurers to many exotic locations.
