  - "desc": "Devorastus moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large\
      \ or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever Devorastus enters a creature's space,\
      \ the creature must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save,\
      \ the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of Devorastus.\
      \ A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed\
      \ saving throw. On a failed save, Devorastus enters the creature's space, the\
      \ creature takes 35 (10d6) acid damage, and is engulfed. The engulfed creature\
      \ can't breathe, has the [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ condition, and takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of Devorastus'\
      \ turns. When Devorastus moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed\
      \ creature can try to escape by making a DC 21 Strength check as an action.\
      \ On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within\
      \ 5 feet of Devorastus."
