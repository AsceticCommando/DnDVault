# [Jacko](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/jacko-hotb.md)
*Source: Heroes of the Borderlands p. 11*  

Jacko advertises his cloak-and-dagger services in seedy places throughout the Borderlands. For the right price, Jacko will trail, rob, rough up, or take out any mark—no questions asked.

Satisfied customers parrot his cheesy slogan: "Jacko always has your back-o."
