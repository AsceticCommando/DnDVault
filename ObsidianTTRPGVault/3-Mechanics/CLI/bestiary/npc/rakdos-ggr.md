# [Rakdos](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 247*  

Rakdos, the demon for whom his cult is named, embodies hedonism. He is also the consummate entertainer, whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the spotlight. His every entrance is a showstopper.

Sometimes after his grand entrance, Rakdos crouches to witness the performances of those who adore him. To them, his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is a demanding spectator. He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brought more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close. Jaded as he is, Rakdos attends his cult's performances only rarely. He often retreats into his lair below the cult's guildhall for months or years at a time, but his followers know that he might emerge at any time to witness the latest spectacle.
