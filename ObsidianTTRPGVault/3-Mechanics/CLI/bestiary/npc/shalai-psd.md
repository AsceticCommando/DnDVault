# [Shalai](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/shalai-psd.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Dominaria p. 9*  

The most visible and recognized symbols of the Church of Serra are her angels—both those that were personally created by Serra and those that appeared spontaneously in the Cathedral at Sursi. Some angels live contemplative lives within the cathedrals, but most are active defenders of the faith, protecting Serra's people across the world. Powerful angels often take responsibility for large regions of the world. Lyra, for example, stands as the protector of Benalia, and Shalai plays a similar role in Llanowar. Serra's angels are believed to hear prayers addressed to Serra, and they have an uncanny tendency to arrive exactly when they are needed.

Any of the angels in the "Monster Manual" can serve as [Serra angels](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/serra-angel-psd.md). The [deva](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/deva-xmm.md) represents the most common angels, while the [planetar](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/planetar-xmm.md) and [solar](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/solar-xmm.md) are appropriate for powerful angels such as [Lyra](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/lyra-psd.md) and [Shalai](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/shalai-psd.md).
