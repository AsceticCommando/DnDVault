# [Edgin Darvis](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/edgin-darvis-hat-tg.md)
*Source: Honor Among Thieves: Thieves' Gallery*  

Edgin Darvis has a talent for improvisation and strategy. He's a musician and tale-teller who relies on charisma first—rather than magic or muscle—to escape trouble. Once a member of the Harpers, a spy organization dedicated to protecting Faerûn's common folk, Edgin has forsworn his oath and turned to thievery to support his family. Edgin's strong moral compass compels him to steal only from people he believes deserve to lose both coin and face.

Edgin's confidence and rakish demeanor make him a natural leader. With carefully chosen words, he inspires the members of his thieves' crew to greatness. But when his past mistakes come calling, Edgin must face the music. He now seeks to make amends to those he's wronged and to confront those who have wronged him.
