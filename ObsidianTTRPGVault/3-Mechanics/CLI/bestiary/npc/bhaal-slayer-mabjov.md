A wholly evil, debased and sadistic god, Bhaal—the God of Murder—is reviled by a majority of Faerûn's pantheon; his divine foes include Chauntea, Helm, Ilmater, Lathander, Lliira and Tyr.

Before his ascension to godhood, Bhaal was a power-hungry adventurer on Toril. Along with his companions Bane and Myrkul, he sought to attain the portfolio of Jergal, God of the Dead. Jergal willingly offered his realm to the Dark Three, though they couldn't decide amongst themselves who would rule. Upon Jergal's suggestion, the three divided his power, deciding how to divide it based on the outcome of a game. The three played a game of knucklebones, and Bane emerged as the victor. He claimed the domains of hatred, strife and tyranny as his own. Myrkul, coming second, chose rule over the dead. Finally, Bhaal chose the divine province of death and murder.

A century ago, Bhaal foresaw that he would die in the Time of Troubles and enacted a plan that would allow him to return to life by creating the Bhaalspawn—mortal children imbued with a fraction of his divine essence. While that plan took more than a century to come to fruition, Bhaal has indeed been reborn. Having been dead for more than a century, he now works to rebuild his following, which will augment his divine power. Some of his most powerful and devout followers include his Bhaalspawn son Sarevok and the famous sky captain Pelyious.

Bhaal has two avatar forms: a corpse-like male humanoid called the Slayer, and a huge beast known as the Ravager. He hunts victims at night in his Slayer form. When he has killed, it gives him the power to transform into the Ravager.
