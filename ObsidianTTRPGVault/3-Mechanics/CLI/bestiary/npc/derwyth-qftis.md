# [Derwyth](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/derwyth-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 52*  

Derwyth lives in Cernant Valley—a forested basin at the foot of the Tegefed Mountains—along with many animals, most of which are small woodland creatures. These animals act as Derwyth's eyes and ears, quickly bringing her news of events in the wood, particularly the arrival and actions of strangers. The creatures also carry messages to more powerful Beasts in the valley that sometimes come to Derwyth's aid.
