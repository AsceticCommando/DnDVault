# [Strefan Maurer](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/strefan-maurer-psi.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Innistrad p. 33*  

The history of Strefan Maurer runs parallel to that of Strahd von Zarovich. After his father's death, Strefan studied magic and forged a pact with the demon Shilgengar in return for the promise of immortality. After murdering his brother Sergei and drinking his blood, Strefan journeyed to Markov Manor and consulted with Edgar Markov. Together, they worked with Shilgengar to create the twelve bloodlines of vampires on Innistrad. Maurer Estate (Castle Ravenloft) was not spirited away to a demiplane—it was already on Innistrad, itself a place of nightmares. And Strefan is not trapped here, so he is not seeking a successor in hopes of escaping. Newcomers to his domain do attract his attention, though, as the possibility of meeting a new consort is always on Strefan's mind.

Strefan's statistics are unchanged from the statistics of [Strahd](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/strahd-von-zarovich-rhw.md) in the Curse of Strahd adventure, except that he lacks the Vampire Weaknesses feature. Instead, Strefan has the weaknesses shared by Innistrad vampires (see that earlier section).
