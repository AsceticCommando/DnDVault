# [Archduke Zariel of Avernus](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/archduke-zariel-of-avernus-bgdia.md)
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 243*  

Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, Zariel succumbed to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells and fell from grace. Asmodeus admired Zariel's passion for war and offered her rulership of Avernus. She accepted his offer and was transformed by Asmodeus into an archdevil.

Zariel's "rise" came at the expense of Bel, her pit fiend predecessor. Zariel and Bel hate each other. To keep Bel busy and out of her sight, Zariel tasks him with forging weapons, armor, and gruesome demon-slaying machines.

To replenish her legions, Zariel needs the souls of mortals to create lemures, which she can then promote to higher forms of devils. Only by tempting mortals with power on the Material Plane and striking bargains with them can she bind them to her in the afterlife.

## Matalotok

Zariel recently defeated the demon lord Kostchtchie and took his hammer, Matalotok, which grants Zariel immunity to cold damage. Without this hammer, Zariel has resistance to cold damage instead.
