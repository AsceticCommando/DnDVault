# [Ogrémoch](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 216*  

The Prince of Evil Earth is Ogrémoch (pronounced oh-gray-mock), the Mountain that Walks. His natural form is a shambling, 50-foot-tall colossus of rock, with crystal growths embedded throughout his body. When he bothers to speak, his voice sounds like grinding stones.

Ogrémoch is a miser who regards all the resources and treasures found in the ground as his own. He holds nothing but contempt for mortals (or any other denizens of the Material Plane) and desires nothing more than to crush and subjugate whomever he encounters. What he can't crush, he endures and outlasts.

Ogrémoch especially resents any mortals that dare to remove valuable metal or stone from the earth, and those who shape or build things of stone. He notices each nugget of gold or raw gemstone removed from areas under his influence, seeking to reclaim treasures "stolen" from him-and to punish the thieves. When the Prince of Evil Earth gains access to the Material Plane through an elemental node, he begins to methodically locate and destroy every mine, quarry, town, or fortification in the area. It's not that he needs the wealth, but the principle of the thing-extracting treasure from the earth-is anathema to Ogrémoch.

## Ogrémoch's Lair

Ogrémoch is normally found in the depths of elemental earth, choosing caverns with black crystals and jagged rock spikes to serve as his throne room. He can enter the Material Plane through large and well-established nodes of elemental earth, with a little help from the proper rituals. Within such a node, Ogrémoch wields great power.

      \ node (including the Black Geode, described in chapter 5). On initiative count\

      \ within 60 feet of Ogrémoch turns to sticky mud. Any creature on the ground\

      \ A creature can take an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the effect\
      \ on itself or another creature within its reach on a success.  \n- Crystalline\
      \ spikes grow from the ground in a 20-foot-radius area within 60 feet of Ogré\
      moch. The area becomes difficult terrain. A creature that moves through the\
      \ affected area takes 1d8 piercing damage for every 5 feet it moves there. Creatures\
      \ that are knocked [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) in the\
      \ area also take this damage.  \n- A violent tremor shakes the lair in a 120-foot-radius\
      \ around Ogrémoch. Each creature other than Ogrémoch on the ground in the area\
      \ must succeed on a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice)\

      broken windows, cracked plaster, items toppled off shelves. The longer Ogré\

      \ into the sinkhole or fissure.  \n- Natural caves and tunnels within 1 mile\
      \ of Ogrémoch's lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane of Earth,\
      \ allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those points.\
      \  \n\nIf Ogrémoch is destroyed or banished back to his home plane, the regional\
      \ effects fade over the next 1d10 days."
