Sheldon is a friendly, good-natured dragon who collects and eats blueberries. When he's not attending parties, he lives in Wildspace. His body magically produces air, allowing him to thrive in a vacuum and create powerful gusts of wind. Sheldon uses the wind to knock down foes and propel himself farther than his wings can take him on their own.
