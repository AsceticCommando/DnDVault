> [!note] Nelvik the Pseudodragon
> 
> Severin has a neutral evil [pseudodragon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon-xmm.md) companion named Nelvik. The pseudodragon is never far from its master. During the ritual to summon Tiamat, it cowers on a ledge in the central spire of the Dragon Queen's temple. If Severin is slain, Nelvik attempts to befriend Severin's slayers, waiting for an opportune time to exact revenge.
