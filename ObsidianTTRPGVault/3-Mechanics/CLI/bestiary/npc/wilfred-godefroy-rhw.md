# [Wilfred Godefroy](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/wilfred-godefroy-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 142*  

Lord Wilfred Godefroy rules the afterlife of all who die in Mordent. Arrogant, impatient, and vengeful, the Darklord seeks any opportunity to exert his control and reinforce his undying noble standing.

Lord Godefroy haunts the House on Gryphon Hill, along with countless other spirits. Wilfred can send mobs of obedient spirits to do his will anywhere in the domain. He uses his control over the dead to influence the living, threatening to harm his victims' dead loved ones if they don't obey his fickle commands.

A generation ago, the creators of the mist-piercing device called the Apparatus vanished from Mordent. Lord Godefroy has discovered the hidden machine, but, to his frustration, lacks a way to use it.
