# [Viktra Mordenheim](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/viktra-mordenheim-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 132*  

From her laboratory at Schloss Mordenheim, Dr. Viktra Mordenheim uses her scientific genius to create horrors and wonders. All manner of undead and constructs march from her laboratory, but such flawed creations don't satisfy Mordenheim. Rather, she seeks to re-create or reclaim her greatest creation, the Unbreakable Heart, a miraculous device that grants life to Mordenheim's elusive reanimated victim, Elise.
