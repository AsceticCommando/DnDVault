# [Nafas](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/nafas-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 210*  

Nafas is the breath of the multiverse, an ancient djinni born from the planar winds that blow through the myriad doors of the Infinite Staircase. He's a timeless force of untold power, a genie made noble by the planes themselves. A cloud of twinkling stardust follows Nafas wherever he goes, as evidence of his cosmic might.

No bottle, vase, ring, or lamp can contain Nafas. The genie is bound to the Infinite Staircase itself, anchored to the extradimensional realm that created him. From the steps of the staircase, Nafas hears the wishes of creatures across the multiverse but cannot act on them. Moved by their stories but barred by circumstance, Nafas relies on adventurers—whom he considers the living manifestations of a wish granted—to respond to these calls.

To friendly adventurers and weary travelers along the staircase, Nafas is a benevolent host, welcoming his guests with feasts, musical performances, and charming tales over tea. However, those who abuse the djinni's hospitality or seek to bind him to their service with Iron Flasks or other magic provoke his tempestuous ire.

When Nafas is provoked, the scope of his retribution is limited only by his imagination. Though the genie typically reserves the Wish spell for creatures he deems worthy of its gifts, he isn't above leveraging that power against formidable threats, rewriting reality to forcibly tilt the scales in his favor.

The multiverse dictates that there must always be a noble djinni to preside over the Infinite Staircase. If slain, Nafas re-forms within days, coalescing from cosmic air. The only way to truly destroy Nafas is to take his place.

> [!note] Nafas as a Patron
> 
> In addition to linking the adventures in this book, you can use Nafas as a group patron (detailed in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything). In this role, Nafas sends adventurers to distant worlds to fulfill the wishes of creatures beyond his reach. Adventurers who return to Nafas successful receive gifts as rewards. As a noble genie, Nafas can also act as a warlock's otherworldly patron, imparting a fraction of his power in exchange for the warlock's loyal service.

## Nafas's Lair

Nafas lairs in the Censer of Dreams, an aeolian palace within the Infinite Staircase where winds and wishes converge (see chapter 1 of Quests from the Infinite Staircase). Windcatchers rise above its spacious chambers and softly glowing domes, and melodious chimes dance in the shutterless windows of its vaulted halls. Held aloft by genie magic and the staircases that branch from it, the palace is a pit stop for planar travelers and a haven for friendly creatures.
