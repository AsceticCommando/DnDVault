# [Edwin Odesseiron](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/edwin-odesseiron-mabjov.md)
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy p. 114*  

In many ways an archetypal Red Wizard, Edwin Odesseiron is an exceedingly arrogant conjuration mage hailing from the eastern nation of Thay. He originally traveled west to the Sword Coast on a mission to kill the Rashemi Wychlaran Dynaheir, both as part of a personal rivalry and under orders from his superior Red Wizards. Once his mission was accomplished, and Dynaheir was dead, Edwin remained on the Sword Coast in order to build up his own personal power without the oversight of the Zulkirs of Thay.

While Edwin had a falling out with the Red Wizards of Thay some time ago, he managed to repair the relationship by delivering one of the Nether Scrolls to the ruler of Thay—Szass Tam. His short time studying the Nether Scroll resulted in some calamitous results, but one of the spells he learned imparted him with the longevity of an elf.

While Edwin will often return to his homeland of Thay, he can most often be found in the city of Baldur's Gate. He has recently taken over Ramazith's Tower and adopted the identity of Lorroakan, the young mage who formerly lived in the tower (now dead by Edwin's hand).

Despite his inarguably high intelligence, Edwin seems to lack common sense. As a result, his grand schemes and power grabs are typically undone by his own hubris and oversights. Edwin almost universally treats others with disdain, openly insulting his "lessers." As much as Edwin detests those he views as his inferiors, he gets along no better with his betters. (His envy of the legendary wizard Elminster Aumar is particularly venomous.) Edwin has a simulacrum of himself that he uses to augment his power or send into dangerous situations. Since he doesn't respect the intelligence of anyone other than himself, he often finds himself engaged in conversation with his simulacrum.
