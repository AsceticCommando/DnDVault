      \ On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
      \ It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success,\
      \ the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified)\

      \ itself with its gaze."
