  - "desc": "If Sandesyl isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action\
      \ to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true\
      \ form.\n\nWhile in bat form, Sandesyl can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet,\
      \ and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size\
      \ and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing\
      \ it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\n\nWhile in mist\
      \ form, Sandesyl can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is\
      \ weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile\
      \ creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space,\
      \ the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It\
      \ has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and\
      \ it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight."

      \ into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious),\
      \ provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform,\
      \ it is destroyed.\n\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert\
      \ to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or\
      \ be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It\
      \ is then [paralyzed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) until it\
      \ regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with\
      \ 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point."

      \ water.  \n- **Stake to the Heart.** If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven\
      \ into Sandesyl's heart while Sandesyl is [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
