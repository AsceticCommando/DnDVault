# [Lord Soth of Sithicus](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-of-sithicus-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 158*  

Lord Loren Soth seethes within a realm that mocks and frustrates him. Having known the rigid standards of knighthood and warfare, Soth finds Sithicus empty and chaotic, his people apathetic and undisciplined. The elven beauty that once captivated him lies ruined, the land burns with the flames of Krynn's Cataclysm, and the realm's shadows remind Soth of his past failures. Worse, no worthy foes exist to challenge him. So Soth broods on his throne in Nedragaard Keep, haunted by banshees that sing the tale of his disgrace and by rotted, undead copies of the knights who once served him.

Lord Soth cares nothing for his domain. But should noteworthy threats or remarkable individuals appear, he seeks to crush or enlist them. The only exception is the spirit of his treacherous former ally, Caradoc. Soth's undead servants and his werebadger seneschal, Azrael Dax, scour the land for the elusive ghost.

Soth shares his imprisonment in Sithicus with all in the domain by keeping its borders perpetually closed. Only those who rouse him to activity or invade Nedragaard Keep might convince him to let them escape. This risks provoking the mighty death knight's wrath, but Soth still thinks of himself as a true knight—he might assist those who present themselves as honorable warriors or show knowledge of his home (see " Influencing Lord Soth ").
