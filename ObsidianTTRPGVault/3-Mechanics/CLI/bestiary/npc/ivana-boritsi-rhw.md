# [Ivana Boritsi](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ivana-boritsi-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 52*  

Ivana Boritsi tires of playing games no one realizes she's already won. The head of Borca's most influential family, Ivana effortlessly manipulates all aspects of society. Her servants, employees, and fractious cousins prove endlessly unreliable, forcing her to attend personally to tedious duties and social functions to maintain her power.

Ivana looks eternally youthful, causing some to doubt her competence and attribute her success to her elder cousin, Ivan Dilisnya. Perpetually bored with and disappointed by predictable people, she takes refuge in her alchemical studies and her gardens of poisonous plants. Her vast knowledge of toxins makes her a peerless poisoner. She uses her creations to make people more pliable and to assassinate those she deems too boorish to live. Secretly, Ivana seeks someone who can match her intellect and relieve her boredom, but she quickly grows weary of even the most charming and clever souls.

      \ the Mists surrounding Borca are filled with briar vines (Ivana) or barbed\
      \ wire (Ivan). The Mists become [Difficult Terrain](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md),\
      \ and whenever a creature moves into or within the Mists, it takes 2d4 Piercing\
      \ damage for every 5 feet it travels. Once Ivana or Ivan closes or opens the\
      \ borders, neither Darklord can do so again until the next dawn.  \n- **Ivana's\
      \ Whispers (Ivana Only).** Ivana can encode a message of 25 words or fewer into\
      \ flowers in Borca at dawn. Until the next dawn, the first time a creature smells\
      \ a flower, it hears the message in its mind, understanding the meaning of the\
      \ message.  \n- **Mystery Letters (Ivan Only).** Whenever Ivan writes a letter\
      \ and addresses it to a creature in Borca whose name he knows and that he's\
      \ seen before, the letter appears near that creature at the next dawn. The letter\
      \ appears in an unobserved but obvious space, such as a bedside table or among\
      \ gear.  \n- **Spies.** While in Borca, Ivana and Ivan can cast [Clairvoyance](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/clairvoyance-xphb.md),\
      \ requiring no Material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting\
      \ ability. To cast the spell, there must be a Large or bigger plant (Ivana)\
      \ or a Tiny doll or similar toy (Ivan) within range from which the sensor appears.\
      \  \n\nIf a Darklord of Borca dies, that Darklord's effects end immediately.\
      \ Those effects resume if that Darklord gains a new body (see [Ivana's](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ivana-boritsi-rhw.md)\
