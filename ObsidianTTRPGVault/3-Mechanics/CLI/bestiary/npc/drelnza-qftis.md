# [Drelnza](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/drelnza-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 197*  

Drelnza is the vampire daughter of Iggwilv. She is the Witch Queen's greatest treasure, an immortal warrior who guards some of her mother's most precious belongings decades after the archmage's mysterious departure. The identity of Drelnza's father is unknown even to her.

Drelnza slumbers deep in the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, rising to dispatch those few who make it to Iggwilv's hoard. As a consequence of Drelnza's prolonged rest, she has yet to regain some of her vampiric powers.

In the years before Iggwilv's disappearance, Drelnza acted as general to a battalion of demons bound to serve the Witch Queen. Armed with her sentient longsword, Heretic, Drelnza terrorized the people of Perrenland.
