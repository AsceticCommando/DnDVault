*Source: Heroes of the Borderlands p. 12*  

This itinerant explorer knows the caves around the Keep on the Borderlands better than anyone else. Vinx frequently delves these caves in search of treasure.

Recently, Vinx got caught in a bind while pursuing a stolen family heirloom. When she gets loose, those goblins won't know what hit them!
