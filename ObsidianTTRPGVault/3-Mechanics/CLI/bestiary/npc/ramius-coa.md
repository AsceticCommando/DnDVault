# [Ramius](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 24*  

Ramius Dangremond is the commander of the Hellriders of Elturel. He never wanted the position, but because of the many deaths within the ranks of the order, he had to step up. His friend and fellow Hellrider, Barachiel, was the main reason he was able to grow into a capable commander. The loss of his friend saddens Ramius, and the news of his imprisonment within the Nine Hells gnaws at his soul.

Ramius is a natural horseman and a gifted athlete. The soldiers he leads often say that there isn't anything that Ramius can't mount or ride. He's ridden horses, mammoths, and machines into battle. Loyalty, honor, and duty are virtues that Ramius upholds. He fears nothing other than losing those he cares for.
