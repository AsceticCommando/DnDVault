# [Ivan Dilisnya](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ivan-dilisnya-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 54*  

Ivan Dilisnya—a spoiled, selfish attention seeker—has the tastes of a child but a withered wreck of a body. Borcan society widely regards this recluse as an innovator and a genius. In truth, he is neither. Ivan is a wicked and off-putting manipulator who, despite his appearance and intellect, affects childlike behaviors and speech patterns for attention. He is alone—despite having been born with everything—and the solitude terrifies him.

By staying out of sight or using deceptive correspondence, Ivan makes his targets doubt reality and overestimate his control. He manipulates people into performing pointless errands for him or spying on his cousin, Ivana Boritsi, whom he believes mocks him and has caused his aged, squalid state.

Ivan surrounds himself with dangerous clockwork toys and fawning, mechanical servants. While he goes through the motions of crafting such devices, the Dark Powers provide him with any creation he desires, no matter how bizarre.

      \ the Mists surrounding Borca are filled with briar vines (Ivana) or barbed\
      \ wire (Ivan). The Mists become [Difficult Terrain](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md),\
      \ and whenever a creature moves into or within the Mists, it takes 2d4 Piercing\
      \ damage for every 5 feet it travels. Once Ivana or Ivan closes or opens the\
      \ borders, neither Darklord can do so again until the next dawn.  \n- **Ivana's\
      \ Whispers (Ivana Only).** Ivana can encode a message of 25 words or fewer into\
      \ flowers in Borca at dawn. Until the next dawn, the first time a creature smells\
      \ a flower, it hears the message in its mind, understanding the meaning of the\
      \ message.  \n- **Mystery Letters (Ivan Only).** Whenever Ivan writes a letter\
      \ and addresses it to a creature in Borca whose name he knows and that he's\
      \ seen before, the letter appears near that creature at the next dawn. The letter\
      \ appears in an unobserved but obvious space, such as a bedside table or among\
      \ gear.  \n- **Spies.** While in Borca, Ivana and Ivan can cast [Clairvoyance](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/clairvoyance-xphb.md),\
      \ requiring no Material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting\
      \ ability. To cast the spell, there must be a Large or bigger plant (Ivana)\
      \ or a Tiny doll or similar toy (Ivan) within range from which the sensor appears.\
      \  \n\nIf a Darklord of Borca dies, that Darklord's effects end immediately.\
      \ Those effects resume if that Darklord gains a new body (see [Ivana's](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ivana-boritsi-rhw.md)\
