# [Bjornhild Solvigsdottir](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/bjornhild-solvigsdottir-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 306*  

It's unusual for a woman to lead a Reghed tribe, but Bjornhild is a most extraordinary woman. The fearless wife of the late King Korold, she fought alongside him in many battles. After a frost giant's mammoth companion slew Korold, the formidable Bjornhild took his place.

Bjornhild worships the Frostmaiden and is so ruthless that her enemies believe she has actual ice flowing through her veins. She has no living children that she knows of, but with Auril's blessing, she won't need any heirs to preserve her legacy. Bjornhild intends to live forever by demonstrating her unwavering faith in the Frostmaiden and becoming the Chosen of Auril.

As if she weren't fearsome enough, Bjornhild has a pet saber-toothed tiger named Grava.
