*Source: RHW p. 279*  

Laurie learned the ways of martial combat from her uncle George, training in techniques to combat the restless dead. She rarely travels without her canine companions, Joan and Tirran, the grown pups of her uncle's foxhounds. She also wields her uncle's magic sword,*Gossamer*, which, according to family legend, contains the soul of a heroic Weathermay ancestor. Laurie suspects that Gennifer is keeping something from her, but she won't pry into her sister's secrets.

## Weathermay-Foxgrove Twins

*Adventurous Paranormal Investigators*

Twins Gennifer and Laurie Weathermay-Foxgrove are monster hunters who've built a reputation as heroes in the domain of "Mordent", and their reputation is spreading in domains beyond. The daughters of the mayor of Mordentshire, Alice Weathermay, the twins can often be found at their home, Heather House, or at that of their adopted uncle, [Doctor Rudolph van Richten](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rudolph-van-richten-rhw.md).

In their youth, Gennifer and Laurie channeled their curiosity and propensity for troublemaking into solving local mysteries. The twins' uncle—renowned monster hunter George Weathermay—returned to Mordent with his fiancée, Natalia Vhorishkova, just before the twins' sixteenth birthday. The twins realized Natalia was manipulating their beloved uncle and eventually exposed her as a werewolf who was using George to pursue Rudolph van Richten. After the twins saved their uncle and the doctor from the werewolf, George and Rudolph encouraged the girls' investigative instincts by training them as monster hunters.

Ever since, Gennifer and Laurie have aided Rudolph in his research and on adventurers across the Land of the Mists. Increasingly, the twins have struck out on their own, allying with heroes such as [Ez d'Avenir](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ez-davenir-rhw.md) and Savra Sunstar to solve mysteries and hunt evil across domains.
