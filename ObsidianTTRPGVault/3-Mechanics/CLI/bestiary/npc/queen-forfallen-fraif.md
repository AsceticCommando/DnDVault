## Queen Forfallen

*Rust-Riddled Pirate Queen*

One of the most influential victims of the supernatural rusting curse throughout the Moonshae Isles is the pirate queen known as Queen Forfallen. She plies the seas in the largest and best-defended ship in the Moonshaes, the prize of her armada, which she's strengthened with rusty metal plates and filled with a crew of bloodthirsty Rusted berserkers (see this chapter).

Queen Forfallen is a strong human woman with long, red hair. Although the rusting curse has transformed most of her extremities into metal, she's thus far resisted the weakening corrosion that the curse typically imparts to its victims. Her crew insists that her unquenchable thirst for plunder keep her hale.
