# [Alustriel Silverhand](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/alustriel-silverhand-veor.md)
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 242*  

Lady Alustriel Silverhand, called the Shining Lady, has been an influential wizard and proponent of good across Toril for centuries. Alustriel is one of the Seven Sisters—immortal daughters of Mystra, the god of magic. The divine energy Mystra passed to Alustriel grants Alustriel incredible power over arcane magic.

Alustriel's youthful appearance as a human woman with silver hair gives no hint of her supernaturally extended life span. She typically wears long robes and wields a unicorn-headed staff, her *Staff of Silverymoon*.

## Personality

Alustriel's primary concerns are to spread kindness, reward virtue, and promote a culture of compassion throughout the multiverse. She is good at building alliances and quick to intervene when she senses a threat to the forces of good. She has traveled far and established safe houses across the planes—such as her sanctum in the city of Sigil. Alustriel doesn't seek personal glory or wealth; her style of influencing the cosmos is quiet yet steady.

## History

Like other Chosen of Mystra, Alustriel is concerned with preserving the Weave, the primary incarnation of magic that permeates Toril. She believes that the Weave favors those who act with mercy and compassion, seeks to deliver lives of security for all, and bolsters people's efforts when they seek to right wrongs and combat evil.

Nowhere are Alustriel and her deeds better known than in the Silver Marches and its capital, Silverymoon. Alustriel ruled Silverymoon for centuries, once disguised as a wizard named Elué Dualen and then later in her true form. She helped create Silverymoon's famous Moonbridge and co-founded the Lady's College, the first school in Faerûn for mages as students rather than as apprentices in service.

Alustriel stepped down as Silverymoon's high mage more than a century ago. Her son, Methrammar Aerasumé, now leads the city and works to uphold his mother's legacy.

Alustriel has partaken in countless adventures before and after her tenure as Silverymoon's high mage. She has befriended famous adventurers such as Drizzt Do'Urden, worked with prominent organizations like the Harpers, and helped prevent or undo many kinds of evil.
