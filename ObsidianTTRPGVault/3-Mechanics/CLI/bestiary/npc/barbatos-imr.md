    "name": "Spellcasting"
  - "desc": "Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits Barbatos corrodes. After\
      \ dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to\

      \ ammunition made of metal that hits Barbatos is destroyed after dealing damage."
    "name": "Rust Monster Cloak"
  - "desc": "Barbatos regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn. If Barbatos\
      \ takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of Barbatos's\
      \ next turn. Barbatos dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and\
      \ doesn't regenerate."

  - "desc": "Barbatos makes two bone shortsword attacks."

      \ for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).\
      \ The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature\
      \ takes an action to shake it."
    "name": "Light Crossbow"
  - "desc": "Barbatos corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object he can see within\
      \ 5 feet of himself. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys\
      \ a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature,\
      \ the creature can make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid Barbatos's touch.\n\
      \nIf the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or\
      \ carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative 1 penalty to the AC it offers.\
      \ Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.\
      \ If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in Barbatos's\
      \ Rust Monster Cloak trait."
