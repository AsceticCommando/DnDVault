# [Saidra d'Honaire](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/saidra-dhonaire-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 72*  

Duchess Saidra d'Honaire knows her life isn't her own—she knows she isn't alive at all—yet she ignores that for the sparkle of empty celebrations and a parody of her ideal life. The duchess terrorizes Dementlieu, forcing the realm to conform to her desires. Those who expose the flaws in her fantasy and remind her of the desperation she once endured, she slays using her life-sapping power.

All can plainly see Duchess d'Honaire isn't one of the living. Nevertheless, servants and sycophants flatter her poise, beauty, and array of lavish masquerade costumes. When not hosting decadent social events, Saidra removes her mask and slips into the night. Through the streets and alleys of Port-a-Lucine, the Darklord prowls as the Red Death: a murderous spirit that preys on liars, the struggling, and all who remind her of her humble origins.

Saidra is overbearing and elitist, despite being unworldly. She fears being exposed as a fraud and projects this fear onto others, violently accusing them of being liars on the barest evidence or sign of vulgarity. Yet, in mysterious letters and rumors, Saidra receives evidence that her own simple, spiteful family dwells somewhere beyond her city. Their confessions could bring all her deceptions to light.
