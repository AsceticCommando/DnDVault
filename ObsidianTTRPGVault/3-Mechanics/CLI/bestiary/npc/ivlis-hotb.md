*Source: Heroes of the Borderlands p. 26*  

Beneath a pretense of charity and goodness, Ivlis is a demon worshiper who leads a wicked cult. She uses deception and skulduggery to advance her power. Though she feigns kindness and compassion in public spaces, Ivlis believes the poor and downtrodden deserve their wretched lot. In battle, her magic is unpredictable.
