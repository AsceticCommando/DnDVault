# [Narthus](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/narthus-hotb.md)
*Source: Heroes of the Borderlands p. 26*  

A craven lackey, Narthus serves Ivlis out of fear rather than loyalty. Narthus spends his days groveling before Ivlis and cruelly whipping new initiates to the Cult of Chaos into shape. Narthus's feral nature leads some cultists to speculate that he was raised by wild animals.

Ivlis prizes Narthus for his obsequity and morbid fascinations. He grows the cult's ranks through macabre rituals, conscripting the dead to serve the cult's depraved goals.
