# [Forge Fitzwilliam](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/forge-fitzwilliam-hat-tg.md)
*Source: Honor Among Thieves: Thieves' Gallery*  

Forge Fitzwilliam is a con artist who manipulates others with lies and flattery. The audacious criminal has left a trail of broken promises and false identities along the Sword Coast. He conceals flexible morals and a ready dagger behind his winning smile.

Forge enjoys the finer things in life, particularly when they result from his own cleverness. Decades of heists and cons haven't slaked his thirst—in fact, his ambitions only grow grander with time.
