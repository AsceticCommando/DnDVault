# [Ramya Vasavadan](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ramya-vasavadan-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 116*  

Ramya Vasavadan desperately fights to claim and hold power over Kalakeri in a brutal cycle of victory and loss with her equally uncompromising siblings. Unlike most Darklords, Ramya struggles to control her domain, leading her to seek allies in opposing her siblings and their treacherous allies.

In her true form, Ramya is an undead horror, but illusions mask her monstrous appearance. Her true nature is revealed by her chilled skin and her reflection, which always appears withered and terrifying.

Although Ramya's siblings, Arijani and Reeva, aren't Darklords of Kalakeri, they motivate the rebellions in Kalakeri and Ramya's torments. This monstrous pair is detailed in " Arijani and Reeva."
