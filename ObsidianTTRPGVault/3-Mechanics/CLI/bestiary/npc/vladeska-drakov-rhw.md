# [Vladeska Drakov](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/vladeska-drakov-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 80*  

General of a demoralized occupying army, Vladeska Drakov rules what little of Falkovnia hasn't been overrun by the dead. A cunning authoritarian, she believes any tactics—no matter how immoral—are permissible in the pursuit of victory. The Mists torment her by keeping her ever on the edge of defeat, exhausting her and forcing her to watch her precision fail in the face of an endless string of emergencies and an undefeatable enemy horde. Drakov is ever being pushed to the edge. Hunger, sleep deprivation, and the endless demands of terrified troops and civilians drive her toward outbursts of paranoia and violence.
