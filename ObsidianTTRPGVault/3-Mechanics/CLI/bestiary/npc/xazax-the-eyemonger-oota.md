  - "desc": "Xazax shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll\
      \ duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:\n\
      \n- **1. Charm Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving\
      \ throw or be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by Xazax\
      \ for 1 hour, or until Xazax harms the creature.  \n- **2. Paralyzing Ray.**\
      \ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or\
      \ be [paralyzed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 minute.\
      \ The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\
      \ the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **3. Fear Ray.** The targeted creature\
      \ must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
      \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of\
      \ its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **4. Slowing Ray.**\
      \ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a\
      \ failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature\
      \ can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on\
      \ its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of\
      \ each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **5. Enervation\
      \ Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw,\
      \ taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on\
      \ a successful one.  \n- **6. Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature,\
      \ it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or Xazax moves it up to 30\
      \ feet in any direction. It is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of Xazax's next turn or until\
      \ Xazax is [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).\
      \  \n\n    If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't\
      \ being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. Xazax can\
      \ also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple\
      \ tool or opening a door or a container.  \n- **7. Sleep Ray.** The targeted\
      \ creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain\
      \ [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for 1 minute.\
      \ The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action\
      \ to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  \n- **8. Petrification\
      \ Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On\
      \ a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
      \ It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success,\
      \ the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified)\
      \ until freed by the  [greater restoration](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
      \ spell or other magic.  \n- **9. Disintegration Ray.** If the target is a creature,\
      \ it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force\
      \ damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes\
      \ a pile of fine gray dust.  \n\n    If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical\
      \ object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving\
      \ throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force,\
      \ this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  \n- **10. Death Ray.** The targeted\
      \ creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10)\
      \ necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.  "
