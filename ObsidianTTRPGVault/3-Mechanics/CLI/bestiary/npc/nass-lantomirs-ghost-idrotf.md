# [Nass Lantomir's Ghost](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/nass-lantomirs-ghost-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 272*  

Nass Lantomir was an apprentice of Zelenn the White, one of five archmages who oversee the Arcane Brotherhood. Nass and Zelenn's relationship started off well, but in recent years it has become painfully obvious to Zelenn that Nass has been slow to master the arcane tradition of divination. Zelenn's suggestion that Nass leave the Hosttower of the Arcane and gain experience abroad left Nass feeling unwanted. After much thought, however, Nass came around to the idea. She could put her magic to the test and carve out a name for herself.

As she was preparing to leave the Hosttower, Nass overheard her master talking to another wizard about a covert expedition to Icewind Dale being undertaken to seek out long-lost magic from a bygone empire. Rather than carry out her original plan, Nass followed her fellow wizards to Icewind Dale. She caught up to them in Bryn Shander and made her presence known, claiming she was sent by her master to aid the expedition with her divinations. Egos and frayed nerves caused the group to split up shortly thereafter, with each wizard determined to succeed alone.

One night while the others slept, Nass stole a [professor orb](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/professor-skant-idrotf.md) (see appendix D) from one of her fellow wizards, Vellynne Harpell. Two of Vellynne's kobold companions witnessed the theft, and Nass killed them with [Melf's acid arrow](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/melfs-acid-arrow-xphb.md) spells before fleeing with the orb.

Nass fled Ten-Towns and headed toward the Sea of Moving Ice, hoping to find a tome called [The Codicil of White](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/the-codicil-of-white-idrotf.md), a book of magic and lore composed by servants of Auril the Frostmaiden. The Arcane Brotherhood believes that this book tells how to reach a lost city of magic entombed in the ice. Before she could obtain the book, Nass perished. She now exists as a ghost, unable to rest until she finds the book. Characters who come upon Nass's frozen remains also find her spellbook and the orb she stole from Vellynne.

## Familiar

Nass's magical familiar, a white arctic weasel acclimated to cold weather named Zelennor, watches over the wizard's frozen remains. It uses the [weasel](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/weasel-xmm.md) stat block in the "Monster Manual" but is a fey instead of a beast. If Zelennor is reduced to 0 hit points, Nass's ghost is unable to cast the [find familiar](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md) spell in order to get it back.

## Spellcasting

As a ghost, Nass can cast the spells she prepared prior to her death—except that the ghost can't cast spells that require material components, which limits its options. Its list of prepared spells shows only those spells it can cast. Although it has no 2nd-level spells available, the ghost can use its 2nd-level spell slots to cast upgraded versions of the [thunderwave](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thunderwave-xphb.md) spell.

## Spellbook

The wooden covers of Nass's spellbook are bound in nothic hide, and silver clasps hold the book shut. Nass's personal sigil is inscribed on the spine, which also bears the title Lantomir's Traveling Libram. The tome contains the following spells: [clairvoyance](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/clairvoyance-xphb.md), [cloud of daggers](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cloud-of-daggers-xphb.md), [counterspell](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/counterspell-xphb.md), [detect magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md), [detect thoughts](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts-xphb.md), [find familiar](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md), [Melf's acid arrow](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/melfs-acid-arrow-xphb.md), [Tenser's floating disk](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tensers-floating-disk-xphb.md), and [thunderwave](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thunderwave-xphb.md).
