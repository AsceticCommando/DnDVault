# [Harkon Lukas](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/harkon-lukas-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 124*  

The charming werewolf Harkon Lukas manipulates those around him to satisfy his narcissistic needs for adulation and control. Endlessly seeking fame, Harkon travels widely, earning applause and accolades. Yet, whenever he returns to a town he's performed in, he finds he's been forgotten. Lukas believes he needs just the right song or inspiration to make himself unforgettable. To that end, he searches for talented protégés, cultivating their skills, then stealing their work. He ensures their loyalty by gifting them copies of his cursed wolf-tooth necklace, Harkon's Bite, or by transforming them into werewolves. He then manipulates these victims into believing only he will accept them.

Harkon wears a signature wide-brimmed hat and wolf-tooth necklace, and he carries a violin he calls Bleeding Heart. He uses flattery to charm those he takes an interest in. A skilled artist who declines the offer to become his protégé often earns his obsession. The Darklord might go to any extreme to claim such performers' talents as his own.
