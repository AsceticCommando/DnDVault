# [Xenk Yendar](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/xenk-yendar-hat-tg.md)
*Source: Honor Among Thieves: Thieves' Gallery*  

Raised in the nation of Thay, Xenk Yendar has sworn an oath of devotion to aid the innocent. Every inch the knight in shining armor, he thrives when inspiring goodness in his allies. The words "Neither virtue nor blade shall break" are etched in Celestial on the blade of his daggersword.

Xenk ages more slowly than a normal human, and with this gift comes the burden of perspective. His longevity has something to do with Szass Tam's nightmarish rise to power and Xenk's narrow escape from the lich.

Now based in Mornbryn's Shield, Xenk travels Faerûn in search of evil to thwart. He approaches problems with absolute seriousness of purpose—an outlook that clashes with Edgin's nonchalance.
