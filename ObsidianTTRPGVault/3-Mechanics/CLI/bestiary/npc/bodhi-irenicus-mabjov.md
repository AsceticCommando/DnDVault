> Van Richten might think he has the market cornered on books about the undead, but he'd be wrong. I've done a great deal of research on vampires, which you can read about in my upcoming book "Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters". Then you can judge who is the expert about undead.

Bodhi was born in the elven city of Suldanessellar. She was the sister of the city's greatest mage, Joneleth Icarus, and shared his interest in the arcane arts, even if she didn't have his talent for it. Jealous of her brother's prestige, she left Suldanessellar, searching for secrets that might make her the equal of Jon. During her journeys she came across the wandering folk known as the Vistani.

The Vistani showed her paths into the foul regions of the Shadowfell, where Bodhi encountered the sinister Dark Powers. Bodhi made a pact with these enigmatic beings and they showed her secrets that would allow her to draw power directly from the elven gods.

Returning to Suldanessellar, Bodhi shared the secrets she had discovered with Joneleth. Her whispers enflamed his desire to gain even greater power. She and her brother embarked on a plot to achieve godhood by draining Suldanessellar's Tree of Life of its magical essence. The ritual would have killed most of the elves in the city, but the pair were thwarted by Ellesime, the city's queen.

For their crimes, the siblings were cursed—stripped of their elven longevity and exiled from their home. Bodhi was enraged at what had happened to her. Despite her brother's protests, she returned to Suldanessellar to try and murder the queen. She slaughtered dozens of her kin before Ellesime finally killed her. But Bodhi did not stay dead. Instead, the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell brought her back as a vampire so that she could continue to corrupt her brother and bring about his final downfall as well.

With her newfound powers, Bodhi helped her brother capture dozens of powerful individuals from across the nation of Amn. One of the victims she brought to her brother for torture and experimentation was the Bhaalspawn named Abdel Adrian, mortal son of the God of Murder. Abdel and his half-sister Imoen escaped and sought vengeance against Bodhi. Eventually they tracked her down and staked her in the heart while she slept in her sarcophagus.

But that wasn't the end of Bodhi's story. Her brother suffered his final downfall shortly after her death, completing the pact Bodhi had originally made with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell. As a result, she and her brother were drawn into a dark reflection of the treetop city in the Domain of Dread. Despite being trapped there, Bodhi and her brother still find ways to torment the elves of Suldanessellar, even as they seek to escape their prison.

Bodhi is exceptionally cruel, sadistic, and evil, delighting in playing with her prey before their destruction. Like her brother, she holds a deep hatred for the elven community she was born into and was later exiled from.
