# [Glasya](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 226*  

Glasya is known by many names: the Dark Prodigy, the Princess of the Nine Hells, and Lord of Malbolge. She maintains control over the erinyes and has a massive following within the downtrodden and the neglected royalty of the other planes. For a long time, she was simply a lesser archdevil, jumping between various courts as she saw fit. It wasn't until the Reckoning, which she helped instigate, that she claimed true power and became ruler of one of the nine layers.

Asmodeus, her father, and Glasya share much in common—particularly their cunning, ambition, and "dedication" to laws. Because of this, despite some of the hatred Glasya has towards her father, the two share a relationship of respect and support.

Even though she busies herself with many important undertakings to further cement her power, being surrounded by beautiful things is also important to Glasya. Similarly, she detests the ugly, punishing those she sees as disgusting. During her brief relationship with Mammon, she was rarely found in his swampy domain, choosing instead to roam other layers. Almost everything that interacts with Glasya either deeply loves or loathes her. She maintains a charming persona, often even converting spies from other archdevils to her side.

Perhaps contributing to her obsession with beauty, Glasya herself is considered stunning. Her jet-black hair and copper skin hide her infernal nature, though her large, leathery wings and small horns give it away. Due to her ability to polymorph at will, she can meet various other standards of beauty as well, always maintaining an outward charm—which helps conceal her foul core.

## Glasya's Lair

Glasya built her fortress lair, Ossiea, from the grotesquely enlarged and distorted skull of Malagard. Behind the walls of the skull, there are numerous opulent levels, within which Glasya conducts the business of ruling her realm or indulges her other interests.
