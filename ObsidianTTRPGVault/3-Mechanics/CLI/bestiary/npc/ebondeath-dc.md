# [Ebondeath](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ebondeath-dc.md)
*Source: Divine Contention*  

Over a thousand years ago, the black dragon Chardansearavitriol, commonly known as Ebondeath, settled in the Mere of Dead Men, making his lair in the ruined citadel of Uthtower. Ebondeath became a dracolich and was worshiped by the Cult of the Dragon until the death god Myrkul's influence waned across Faerûn and the dragon's bones turned to dust.
