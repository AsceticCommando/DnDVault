# [Sir Braford](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/sir-braford-tftyp.md)
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 243*  

While traveling in the vicinity of the Sunless Citadel, Sir Braford and his companions were captured by goblins. The young paladin of Pelor has been corrupted by the sinister Gulthias Tree and now swings his magic sword, [Shatterspike](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/shatterspike-tftyp.md), on behalf of a different sort of "deity."
