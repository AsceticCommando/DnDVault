# [Morte](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/morte-tofw.md)
*Source: Turn of Fortune's Wheel p. 10*  

The talking skull Morte is a curmudgeonly interplanar traveler plucked from his eternal punishment in the Nine Hells. Tormented by the lies he told in life, Morte masks his pain with a morbid sense of humor and an insufferable dose of sarcasm.
