  - "desc": "If Sangora isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action\
      \ to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true\
      \ form.\n\nWhile in bat form, Sangora can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet,\
      \ and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size\
      \ and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing\
      \ it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\n\nWhile in mist\
      \ form, Sangora can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is\
      \ weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile\
      \ creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space,\
      \ the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It\
      \ has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and\
      \ it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight."
    "name": "Shapechanger"
  - "desc": "If Sangora fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead."
    "name": "Legendary Resistance (3/Day)"
  - "desc": "When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, Sangora transforms\
      \ into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious),\
      \ provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform,\
      \ it is destroyed.\n\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert\
      \ to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or\
      \ be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It\
      \ is then [paralyzed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) until it\
      \ regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with\
      \ 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point."
    "name": "Misty Escape"
  - "desc": "Sangora regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least\
      \ 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Sangora takes radiant\
      \ damage or damage from [holy water](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/holy-water-xphb.md),\
      \ this trait doesn't function at the start of Sangora's next turn."

      \ enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.  \n- **Harmed\
      \ by Running Water.** Sangora takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running\
      \ water.  \n- **Stake to the Heart.** If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven\
      \ into Sangora's heart while Sangora is [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ in its resting place, Sangora is [paralyzed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed)\
      \ until the stake is removed.  \n- **Sunlight Hypersensitivity.** Sangora takes\
      \ 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight,\
      \ it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.  "

  - "desc": "*Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8\

      \ (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit\
      \ point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken,\
      \ and Sangora regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until\
      \ the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its\
      \ hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the\
      \ ground rises the following night as a [vampire spawn](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire-spawn-xmm.md)\

    "name": "Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)"
  - "desc": "Sangora targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the\
      \ target can see Sangora, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw\
      \ against this magic or be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ by Sangora. The [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target\
      \ regards Sangora as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the\
      \ target isn't under Sangora's control, it takes Sangora's requests or actions\
      \ in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Sangora's\
      \ bite attack.\n\nEach time Sangora or Sangora's companions do anything harmful\
      \ to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself\
      \ on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Sangora is destroyed,\
      \ is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action\
      \ to end the effect."
