# [Strahd von Zarovich](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/strahd-von-zarovich-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 42*  

Count Strahd von Zarovich has lost all he ever desired—over and over again. Tormented by the Dark Powers, Strahd is haunted by visions of his lost family and tarnished nobility. The count spends long years brooding in the depths of Castle Ravenloft, but a reincarnation of his obsession appears every generation: Tatyana. Each time Tatyana's reincarnation emerges, Strahd seeks to undo the failures of his past and find a way to win her love. Time and time again, Strahd's heartless, domineering nature causes his bloody history to repeat itself and drives Tatyana beyond his clutches.

A severe, aristocratic figure, the count has the bearing of a former soldier and the impatience of one used to being obeyed. He feels little but occasionally embraces the novelty of toying with amusing strangers or breaking the spirits of his enemies. During his unnaturally long existence, he has learned many occult secrets and mysteries of the Domains of Dread. Strahd's dignified bearing crumbles when someone breaks his laws or denies him what he desires. In such cases, Strahd makes bloody examples of his opponents, drawing out his vengeance into campaigns of terror.
