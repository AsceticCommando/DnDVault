> You mortals should take pride in how you can make a hell out of any heaven.

Various myths claim that Asmodeus, has existed since the dawn of time. Perhaps most intriguing among the myths is the Serpent of Law. In it, Asmodeus was initially named Ahriman and, together with his rival Jazirian, created the outer realms. Their conflict led both deities to become severely wounded, and Asmodeus lost the exchange by landing in the Nine Hells. Here, he used his allies and own strength to banish the previous inhabitants and become what he remains today—Overlord of the Nine Hells.

Since his time as ruler, Asmodeus has seen much upset: a trial by gods, the Blood War, and the Reckoning. Despite many attempts to oust him, Asmodeus has never left his throne—none have even gotten close. Helping cement his power are the Dark Eight, a group of pit fiends sworn to absolute loyalty that rule his armies.

Those that know Asmodeus would describe him as arrogant, extremely intelligent, strategic, and honorable. Whenever possible, he follows the laws and regulations (that he himself created), and rarely loses his temper. Some of his plots have taken thousands of years to come to fruition, with countless others continuing to this day. Whether his persona is genuine, or simply another tool in his plans, only Asmodeus himself knows.

Many groups pledge allegiance to Asmodeus, and being the ruler of the Nine Hells, he has a large quantity of followers and worshippers. His biggest goal, largely unknown by mortals, is the opposite—encourage disbelief in deities altogether. According to legend, instead of going to the god they refuse worship, atheists go directly to the Nine Hells. Asmodeus feeds on these souls, which give him the necessary nourishment to lick his wounds. To this end, worshippers and cults dedicated to Asmodeus frequently experience fluctuations in presence, in an attempt to push them to disbelief.

Some claim that his true form is that of a colossal serpent, with gaping wounds and a missing tail. However, no living creature has seen the true Asmodeus. He prefers to do business using one of his ten avatars, each a perfect gentleman, and handsome to boot. They can be identified by the Ruby Rod they each carry, an icon representative of the Dark Lord himself.

## Asmodeus's Lair

The master of the Nine Hells makes his lair in his citadel of Malsheem. Within its confines linger millions of devils, and all of them are subject to Asmodeus's will and whims.
