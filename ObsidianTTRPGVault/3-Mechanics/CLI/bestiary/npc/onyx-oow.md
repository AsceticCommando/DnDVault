*Source: The Orrery of the Wanderer p. 186*  

Onyx is a regular cat, with special traits, and a modified attack, that only apply when used in the Onyx Ascendant encounter.

Further information can be found within that encounter on how to run it.

Without the special circumstances from that encounter, Onyx can be considered a standard cat
