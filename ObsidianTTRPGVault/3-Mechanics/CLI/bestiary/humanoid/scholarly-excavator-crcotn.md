Field research is often dangerous work, especially when it involves ancient magic and monster-infested ruins. Scholarly excavators are trained to deal with those dangers, adept at protecting their allies and clearing obstacles from their path.

## Scholars of Allsight

The Allegiance of Allsight is a scholarly faction that operates primarily within the Marquesian metropolis of Ank'Harel. Though most members of the allegiance are academics unfamiliar with combat, the faction's field agents are skilled archaeologists who are also trained to contend with and overcome the threats that lurk in the depths of Exandria.
