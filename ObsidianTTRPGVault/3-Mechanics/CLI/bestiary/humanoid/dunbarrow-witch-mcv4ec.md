In the misty marsh of Dunbarrow, the witches of the Eldraine wilds scheme. They crave power by any means, and they aren't above cheating, sacrificing, or allying with whatever they believe will get them closer to that power.

Much of a Dunbarrow witch's magic is performed at cauldrons and delivered as a poison or potion. The most aggressive witch spells take the form of shattering mirrors.

> [!note] Companion Creatures
> 
> Various creatures serve the witches of Dunbarrow. It's not uncommon to see ravens and bats flitting through the canopy, or cats or otters scurrying through the undergrowth, to deliver messages to allies or rivals across the marsh. Some witches animate bundles of sticks and roots to do their errands about the marsh for them, while others animate furniture, weapons, or other objects.
> 
> Feel free to build encounters with witches that include additional creatures such as animated armor, a flying sword, a rug of smothering, or a Tiny Beast acting as a spy.
