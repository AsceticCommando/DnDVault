# [Kraul Warrior](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kraul-warrior-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 213*  

Kraul society is organized into well-defined roles and castes. The vast majority of the kraul occupy various tiers of soldiery, from commanders and elite troops down to the lowliest infantry.

## Kraul

The kraul are an ascendant power group within the Golgari Swarm, long content to linger at the margins of the undercity but now increasingly making their buzzing voices heard in the subterranean Golgari guildhall. These six-legged, insectile beings are hard-headed and literal-minded, with little grasp of metaphor or nuance.
