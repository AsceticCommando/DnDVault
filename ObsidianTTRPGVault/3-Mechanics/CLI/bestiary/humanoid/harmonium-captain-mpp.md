Harmonium captains lead peacekeeper patrols throughout Sigil. They bolster their subordinates in battle and bring the authority of the Harmonium crashing down on suspects with their commands.

      \ The effect ends early if the target takes damage or if it successfully completes\

      \ is directly harmful to itself, such as commanding it to walk into fire.\n\n\
      A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\
      \ the effect on itself on a successful save."
