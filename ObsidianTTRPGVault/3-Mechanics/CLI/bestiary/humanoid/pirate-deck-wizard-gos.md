# [Pirate Deck Wizard](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-deck-wizard-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 248*  

These salt-encrusted practitioners of magic are at once learned and superstitious. The crews of pirate ships generally give their deck wizards a wide berth, as they magically step from place to place and unleash their briny magic against attackers. The ship Sea Ghost in The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh is home to a pirate deck wizard named Punketah.
