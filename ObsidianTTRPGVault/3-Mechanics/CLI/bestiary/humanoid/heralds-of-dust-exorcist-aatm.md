# [Heralds of Dust Exorcist](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/heralds-of-dust-exorcist-aatm.md)
*Source: Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary*  

Dauntless in the face of death, exorcists in the Heralds of Dust cleanse hapless creatures and resting places haunted by ghosts, specters, and other malign entities that prevent the dead from being interred or jeopardize those already in repose. Though most Duster exorcists conduct their operations in the Mortuary, many heed calls throughout Sigil and the planes beyond.

The vagaries of undeath make spirits difficult to predict. Nevertheless, exorcists are well equipped for their work. Molded by experiences with apparitions and their ilk, exorcists channel the forces of death to preserve the living, commune with the dead, and drive evil spirits back to their graves. They can also fire versatile bolts of necrotic or radiant energy from their staves to repel a host of supernatural entities.

An exorcist's senses pierce the veil of death to perceive wandering ghosts on the Ethereal Plane as well as shadow demons, wraiths, and other incorporeal entities hiding in palls of darkness. With a brief reboant chant, an exorcist can expunge a harmful entity from a possessed creature—or make that creature vulnerable to a painful spiritual inhabitation.
