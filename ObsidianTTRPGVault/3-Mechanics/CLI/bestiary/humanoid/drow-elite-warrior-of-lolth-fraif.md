# [Drow Elite Warrior of Lolth](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow-elite-warrior-of-lolth-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 260*  

Elite warriors of Lolth lead raids and command garrisons in the Underdark.

## Drow of Lolth

*Elves Who Serve the Spider Queen*

Throughout the vast Underdark, in cities such as Menzoberranzan, many drow worship Lolth, the Spider Queen. Exiled from the surface world millennia ago, these drow now consider the Underdark to be their true home. Their insidious schemes include raiding the surface, plotting against each other, and preparing for ultimate war.
