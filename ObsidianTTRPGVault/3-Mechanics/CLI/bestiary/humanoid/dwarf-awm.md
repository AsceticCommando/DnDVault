Although there are no dwarves that live in the actual Dankwood, they will sometime pass through in travel or explore the forest for coveted materials and magical stones. They pride themselves in their skills and can create beautiful artifacts from the objects they find in nature.

The dwarves in the area are naturally cautious towards goblins. They will go out of their way to avoid contact and rarely stay for long periods in the Dankwood.
