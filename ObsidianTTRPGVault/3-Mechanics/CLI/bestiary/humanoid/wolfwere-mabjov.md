Wolfweres are shapeshifters that have the natural form of a large wolf but can transform at will into both humanoid and bipedal hybrid shapes. These hateful creatures are much more intelligent than a normal wolf and use this preternatural cunning to hunt their favorite prey: humans. Although some believe them to be the offspring of werewolves and normal wolves—and this may very well be their origin—wolfweres are their own species and their form of lycanthropy is not a transmissible curse or disease. Like werewolves, wolfweres are repelled by wolfsbane but are vulnerable to iron rather than silver weapons.

## Strange Packs

Although some wolfweres are solitary, others choose to stay in familial bands. However, they most often run in packs of normal wolves or worgs. Wolfweres are able to influence and command these beasts, making them much more vicious and bolder. Rarely, a wolfwere may choose to blend in with human society. Wolfweres never associate with werewolves, as the two share a mutual hatred and will attack each other unprovoked.

## Myriad Forms

A wolfwere's natural form is similar in size and appearance to that of a dire wolf. In combat, they usually shift into a hybrid form, which is able to both bite and use weapons with its human-like hands. To trick stronger prey, a wolfwere dons a charismatic human shape. Unlike werewolves, wolfweres have no single humanoid form to revert to. Instead, a wolfwere can transform into any humanoid shape it desires, though they almost universally choose ones with great physical beauty. Wolfweres have the ability to sense what their particular prey would find attractive and assume a seductive disguise. Wolfweres have less control over their appearance when they involuntarily transform under a new moon, though they usually assume a shape they have taken on recently.

## A Sedating Melody

While in their humanoid forms, wolfweres have the ability to sing a song that induces a lethargy in their prey that is similar to a [slow](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/slow-xphb.md) spell. Many wolfweres play stringed instruments and pose as bards to avoid arousing suspicion while they work their charms.
