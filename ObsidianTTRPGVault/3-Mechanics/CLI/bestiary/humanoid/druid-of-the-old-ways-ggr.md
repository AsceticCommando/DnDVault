# [Druid of the Old Ways](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid-of-the-old-ways-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 239*  

The druids of the Old Ways are the keepers of ancient Gruul traditions devoted to the primal ferocity of animal gods such as Ilharg the Raze-Boar and Kashath the Stalker.

## The End-Raze

The druids of the Old Ways believe that civilization will never be eradicated by scattered raids and petty skirmishes. They cling to the idea of a coming apocalypse, the End-Raze, when Ilharg's hoofs will trample every brick and stone of Ravnica's soaring skylines to rubble. The world will return to a state of nature in which the lawless code of muscle and savagery will reign once again.
