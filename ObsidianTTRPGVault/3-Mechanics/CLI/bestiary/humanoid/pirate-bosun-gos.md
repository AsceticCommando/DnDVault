# [Pirate Bosun](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pirate-bosun-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 247*  

The bosun (or boatswain) is tasked with organizing the cargo and crew aboard a ship. Bosuns are capable fighters whose experience with hauling cargo and delivering beatings make them tough opponents. Foul Frithoff in The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh is the bosun who protects the cargo aboard the smugglers' ship. Ever since a bad accident, he has worn a hook at the end of one arm in place of a hand.
