# [Zhentilar Soldier](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhentilar-soldier-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 285*  

Zhentilar soldiers occupy Zhentarim fortresses and outposts. The price of betraying the organization is so steep that many Zhentilar soldiers would rather die for the Zhentarim than abandon their post.

## Zhentilar

*Wardens of the Zhentarim*

The Zhentilar is the militant wing of the Zhentarim. Zhentilar forces occupy Zhentarim strongholds such as Zhentil Keep and Darkhold and defend these places from the Zhentarim's many enemies. If the Zhentarim is one big family, then the Zhentilar are the protective older siblings who look out for their kin.

Zhentilar also conduct other important organizational work such as safeguarding powerful magic items or escorting Zhentarim leaders.
