# [Champion of Madarua](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/champion-of-madarua-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 220*  

Champions of Madarua represent the most skilled warriors in the faction. Hardened by battle, they lead the charge into the fray and inspire their fellow warriors to strike with decisive fury.

## Warriors of Madarua

Members of the Warriors of Madarua wear bronze masks that depict the determined the face of Madarua, an ancient Cynidicean god of birth, death, and the seasons. Each member bears a small tattoo of a sickle on the inside of their left wrist.

Warriors of Madarua recognize and respect the ever-changing complexity of life. In combat, they strive to be as fierce and unpredictable as nature itself.
