*Source: Muk's Guide To Everything He Learned From Tasha p. 32*  

Dankwood duergar live in the deep caves below and are constantly on the search for treasure and magical discoveries they can claim as their own. Like their dwarven relatives, the Dankwood duergar are masters at crafting, but never seem to be happy or satisfied with their creations.

Some say that their constant pouting is what allows them the magical ability to double in size and strength for short moments. Now that's a temper tantrum!
