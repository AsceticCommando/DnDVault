# [Zhentilar Paladin of Bane](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/zhentilar-paladin-of-bane-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 285*  

The Zhentilar's most-respected commanders and sergeants tend to be spellswords or holy warriors who worship nefarious higher powers, such as Bane.

## Zhentilar

*Wardens of the Zhentarim*

The Zhentilar is the militant wing of the Zhentarim. Zhentilar forces occupy Zhentarim strongholds such as Zhentil Keep and Darkhold and defend these places from the Zhentarim's many enemies. If the Zhentarim is one big family, then the Zhentilar are the protective older siblings who look out for their kin.

Zhentilar also conduct other important organizational work such as safeguarding powerful magic items or escorting Zhentarim leaders.
