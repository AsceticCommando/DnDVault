# [Nevermind Gnome Mastermind](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/nevermind-gnome-mastermind-mcv2dc.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 2: Dragonlance Creatures p. 11*  

The gnome masterminds of Mount Nevermind temper their creativity with years of experience. While they still create wild inventions on a whim, these masterminds also wield at least one more stable clockwork invention—typically something that affords the mastermind more movement, extends their reach with extra appendages, or both.

## Nevermind Gnomes

Mount Nevermind is a hollow, dormant volcano on the island of Sancrist in Krynn. Within the mountain, a vibrant community of rock gnome tinkerers and other inventors relentlessly study various scientific pursuits to create mechanical marvels.
