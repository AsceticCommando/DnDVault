# [Pral](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/pral-hotb.md)
*Source: Heroes of the Borderlands p. 6*  

Pral's boyishly handsome, self-assured grin graces wanted posters throughout the Borderlands. A self-proclaimed "gentleman thief," Pral abides by a strict personal code. He never kills, and he always upholds his end of any bargain he makes. A lover of good food, comfortable lodgings, and stylish clothing, Pral squanders the spoils of each robbery on his extravagant lifestyle.
