# [Young Amonkhet Dragon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-amonkhet-dragon-psa.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 33*  

Dragons are fierce monsters with heavy reptilian bodies, crocodilian heads, and leathery wings, and are distinguished by their ability to breathe fire. Though Nicol Bolas is also a dragon, he feels no kinship for these savage, dim-witted beasts. They live mostly in the remote reaches of the desert, soaring in lazy circles through the sky as they search for prey. Sometimes they are captured and brought inside the Hekma, where they are put to use within the trials of the five gods—especially in the climactic battles of the final Trial of Zeal.

The dragons of Amonkhet are **red dragons**, though they lack the high Intelligence of the red dragons in the "Monster Manual".
