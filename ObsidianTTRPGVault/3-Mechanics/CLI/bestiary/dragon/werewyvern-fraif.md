## Werewyvern

*Changed by the Venom of the Wyvern*

Among the rarest of were-creatures, werewyverns change from their humanoid forms into lean wyverns or into draconic-humanoid hybrids. Most werewyverns possess a draconic greed and ferocity and thus often find work as bandits, mercenaries, or assassins. They are opportunistic warriors and prefer ambushes when possible. Werewyverns like to keep their wyvern form a secret until they need an upper hand in a fight or an aerial escape.

Werewyverns transmit lycanthropy through their potent venom. The curse's transmission is unpredictable and often as much a surprise to the werewyvern as it is to the victim.
