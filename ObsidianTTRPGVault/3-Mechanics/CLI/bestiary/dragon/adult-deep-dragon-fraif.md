# [Adult Deep Dragon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-deep-dragon-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 258*  

The strange magic pervading the Underdark twists deep dragons as they grow, so few adult deep dragons look alike. Their skin is usually pitted by fungal growths that spread across the body. Although lacking the versatile shape-shifting of metallic dragons, deep dragons can assume the form of animals or humanoids and often masquerade as snakes or dragonborn.

Adult deep dragons eliminate challengers with ferocious might, cunning ambushes, or fungal poisons. Some adult deep dragons plunder the surface for treasures and lore.

## Deep Dragons

*Dragons of Caverns and Secrets*

Deep dragons slither through the wet and lightless places of the Underdark. They are stealthy hunters with an affinity for lost lore and fungi that flourish in the depths. As deep dragons age, their smooth, serpentine bodies become riddled with fungal rot, particularly around their faces, to imbue their breath with terror-inducing spores.

Deep dragons covet treasure and knowledge. Some deep dragons seek to gain knowledge via experience and travel, slithering through caverns and seas of the Underdark to map hidden passages for dozens of miles. Other deep dragons enjoy cultivating groves of molds and fungi, including colossal varieties sufficient to conceal the dragons' sinuous forms. Many deep dragons collect forgotten tomes or works of art and bully, cajole, or steal collections from drow or duergar sages.

Deep dragons are excellent swimmers. They often clash with aquatic Underdark societies, such as kuo-toa. Many deep dragons demand tribute from these groups in the form of food or treasure.

Underdark explorers have many reasons to brave deep dragon lairs beyond treasure hunting; they might contain the only surviving copies of forgotten lore, fungal ingredients for cures or plagues, or maps to lost Underdark locales.

## Deep Dragon Lairs

Deep dragons lair in fungus-encrusted caverns of the Underdark or old, forgotten ruins, preferring locations near subterranean bodies of water.
