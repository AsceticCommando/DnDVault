# [Styx Dragon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/styx-dragon-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 252*  

One of the only draconic beings that makes its home in the Nine Hells, the Styx dragon is an aquatic creature that lives within the River Styx. The waters of the Styx have no effect on its mental faculties or memories, and their breath weapon replicates the effects of the Styx. Their diet consists mostly of devils foolish enough to wander close to the banks of the Styx, though they prefer mortals and corpses over Fiends. Occasional Styx dragons have been spotted in non-infernal planes, possibly by traveling the Styx to their destination.

## Unusual Dragons

Unlike other Dragons, the scales of the Styx dragon have no effect on their capabilities, and range from darker hues all the way up to chromatic scales, though they always appear muddied. They have no wings and very small limbs, relying primarily on their tails for mobility and combat. Their serpentine body lends itself to muddy nests along the banks of the Styx and quick underwater travel. Good captains know where Styx dragon clutches are along the river, and steer their boats specifically to avoid the creatures.
