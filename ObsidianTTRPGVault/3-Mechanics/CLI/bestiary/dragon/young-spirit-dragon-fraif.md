# [Young Spirit Dragon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-spirit-dragon-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 277*  

Curious and self-confident, young spirit dragons can cause trouble for a region's other denizens, by either unleashing long-buried evils or misusing scarcely understood ancient magic.

## Spirit Dragons

*Draconic Scions of an Ancient Empire*

Spirit dragons, sometimes called song dragons, are powerful dragons whose powers stem from the magic and history of fallen realms. They embody the spirit of a bygone age, and so as they grow and mature, they develop an erratic control over time.

A spirit dragon's primary motivation is to unearth and study the ruins of the ancient realm from which it arose. Spirit dragons share an innate intellectual curiosity, and many have a deep appreciation for the culture and art of humanoid societies.

Spirit dragons find even the most commonplace melodies moving. A song written in the time and region from which a spirit dragon hails can potentially overwhelm the dragon, driving it to either morose despondence or passionate rage.

No two spirit dragons are exactly alike; each individual bears features distinct to the empire from which it hails. Roll on or choose a result from the Spirit Dragon Origins table to determine which lost realm a spirit dragon is from.
