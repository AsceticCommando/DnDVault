# [Spirit Dragon Wyrmling](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/spirit-dragon-wyrmling-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 277*  

When a dragon egg is found buried among ancient rubble and given the right conditions, a spirit dragon wyrmling might hatch from the egg. Left to its own devices, a wyrmling wanders the ruins that the dragon originated from.

## Spirit Dragons

*Draconic Scions of an Ancient Empire*

Spirit dragons, sometimes called song dragons, are powerful dragons whose powers stem from the magic and history of fallen realms. They embody the spirit of a bygone age, and so as they grow and mature, they develop an erratic control over time.

A spirit dragon's primary motivation is to unearth and study the ruins of the ancient realm from which it arose. Spirit dragons share an innate intellectual curiosity, and many have a deep appreciation for the culture and art of humanoid societies.

Spirit dragons find even the most commonplace melodies moving. A song written in the time and region from which a spirit dragon hails can potentially overwhelm the dragon, driving it to either morose despondence or passionate rage.

No two spirit dragons are exactly alike; each individual bears features distinct to the empire from which it hails. Roll on or choose a result from the Spirit Dragon Origins table to determine which lost realm a spirit dragon is from.
