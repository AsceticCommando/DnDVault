    "name": "Slam"
  - "desc": "The kelpie chooses one humanoid it can see within 150 feet of it. If\

      \ throw or be magically [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ while the kelpie maintains [concentration](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration),\
      \ up to 10 minutes (as if [concentrating](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ on a spell). The [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target\
      \ is [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), and\
      \ instead of holding its breath underwater, it tries to breathe normally and\
      \ immediately runs out of breath, unless it can breathe water. If the [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ target is more than 5 feet away from the kelpie, the target must move on its\
      \ turn toward the kelpie by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet.\
      \ It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks.\n\nBefore moving into damaging terrain,\
      \ such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than\
      \ the kelpie or drowning, the target can repeat the saving throw. A [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If\
      \ the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.\n\nA target that successfully\
      \ saves is immune to this kelpie's hypnosis for the next 24 hours."
