*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle p. 46*  

Spore servants are dead creatures reanimated by the magical spores of a myconid leader. The final act of the myconid leader in Seagrow Caves before lapsing into its current comatose state was creating a spore servant from a dead giant octopus to protect the caves while the leader could not. Unlike a living octopus, this guardian has only basic control over its tentacles. Rather than coiling around intruders to immobilize them, the spore servant simply bludgeons them.
