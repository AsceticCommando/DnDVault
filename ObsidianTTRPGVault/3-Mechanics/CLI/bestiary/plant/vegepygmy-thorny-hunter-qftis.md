# [Vegepygmy Thorny Hunter](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/vegepygmy-thorny-hunter-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 219*  

Thorny hunters are bestial vegepygmies derived from the corpses of bears, dogs, and other quadrupedal Beasts. Thorny hunters act like bloodhounds, following their master's orders to hunt prey with deadly ferocity.

## Vegepygmies

Also called mold folk, vegepygmies are fungal creatures that spring forth from the body of a Humanoid or Giant killed by russet mold, a poisonous fungus rumored to have originated from beyond the stars.

Vegepygmies gather in small bands, communicating with a combination of gestures, hisses, and rhythmic taps. While vegepygmies can sustain themselves by absorbing nutrients from soil and other organic matter, they prefer a carnivorous diet achieved through hunting and scavenging. Vegepygmies can live indefinitely so long as the climate remains hospitable to their fungal bodies.

To learn more about vegepygmies, see Monsters of the Multiverse.
