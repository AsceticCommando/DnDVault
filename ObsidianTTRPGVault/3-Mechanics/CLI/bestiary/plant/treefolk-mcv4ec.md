# [Treefolk](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\plant/treefolk-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

The wise and ancient treefolk thrive in the depths of Eldraine's forested wilds. Though many treefolk rival members of the high fae in age, they rarely interfere with the goings-on of the faerie court. Instead, treefolk serve as guardians and shepherds of their wild groves, dispensing wisdom and blessings to travelers who wander under their branches.
