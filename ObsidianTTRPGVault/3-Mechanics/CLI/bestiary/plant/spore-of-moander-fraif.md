## Spore of Moander

*Hulking Heap of the Rotting God*

A spore of Moander is a rotting mass of vegetation infused with the divine power of Moander, dead god of corruption and decay. Spores arise on the Material Plane where Moander's influence can still be felt: primordial swamps, ancient forests, and miasmic lagoons touched by Abyssal evil.

A spore of Moander has no grand agenda beyond spreading death and sorrow. Still, cultists of Moander look on these terrible creatures with reverence, believing that each spore is a window into the unknowable mind of Moander.
