# [Bodytaker Plant](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/bodytaker-plant-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 237*  

A bodytaker plant uses its powerful vines to capture victims or accept captives brought to it by podling servants. The plant drags prey into an attached pod where the captive is dissolved over the course of hours. After the process is complete, a duplicate of the captive emerges as a subservient podling. Nothing of the original creature remains, though its noncompostable gear might be recovered after the bodytaker plant is slain.

A bodytaker plant's podlings are extensions of the plant's will, and the plant has no qualms about sacrificing podlings or using them as shields in battle. While bodytaker plants can communicate telepathically, most do so only in desperate cases, preferring to speak through their podlings—potentially speaking through several at once.

A bodytaker plant grows where its seed fell from space, or it might later have its podlings relocate it to a hidden sanctuary. Roll on or choose a result from the Bodytaker Plant Sanctuary table to inspire where such a plant might grow.

## Bodytaker Plants

*Body-Snatching Alien Flora*

Bodytaker plants are intelligent organisms that originated on a long-ruined planet of the Material Plane. To outlive their doomed world, these enigmatic plants spread their seeds to the stars. In rare cases, their meteorite-like seeds fall to fertile worlds and take root. What emerges is a new bodytaker plant that seeks to grow and propagate until its kind dominates the entire world. As assistants, the plant creates eerie vegetative duplicates of the world's inhabitants called bodytaker podlings. Podlings serve the bodytaker plants' will, infiltrating societies and replacing the individuals they resemble. Ultimately, podlings seek to isolate inhabitants so they can become fertilizer for the bodytaker plant that created them or fodder for more podlings.
