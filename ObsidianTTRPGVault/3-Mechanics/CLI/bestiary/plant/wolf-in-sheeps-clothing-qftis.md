# [Wolf-in-Sheep's-Clothing](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/wolf-in-sheeps-clothing-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 221*  

A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is a predatory plant that resembles a tree stump. It hides in areas of thick vegetation and has a bark-like hide, eyestalks like vines or withered flowers, rootlike tentacles, and a fleshy growth atop its body that it uses to lure prey toward its fang-filled maw.

Wolves-in-sheep's-clothing can reshape their lures to mimic the appearance of various small, often adorable creatures to entice their prey. The Lure Forms table suggests some forms the lure might take.
