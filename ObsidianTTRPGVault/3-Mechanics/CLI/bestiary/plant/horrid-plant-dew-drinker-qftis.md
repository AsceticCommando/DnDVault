      \ (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it\
      \ has the [grappled](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition\
      \ (escape DC 14), and the horrid plant can pull the target up to 25 feet closer\

      \ one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage\
      \ taken, and the horrid plant regains hit points equal to that amount. This\
      \ reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if\
      \ this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0."
