# [Creepy Doll](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/creepy-doll-psi.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Innistrad p. 25*  

Many of the evils that plague humanity on Innistrad arise from within humanity itself, and among the most terrible of these are creatures built by human hands. Some of these are animated by the magic of [necro-alchemists](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/necro-alchemist-psi.md) or witches, but others are inhabited and given life by hostile spirits or other malign forces. These include [gargoyles](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle-xmm.md) and [scarecrows](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/scarecrow-xmm.md), haunted dolls and suits of [animated armor](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-armor-xmm.md), [stone golems](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/stone-golem-xmm.md) formed of gravestones and mausoleums, and [homunculi](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/homunculus-xmm.md) created by stitchers and [necro-alchemists](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/necro-alchemist-psi.md).

      \ and [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It otherwise\

      \ within 5 feet of each other for such an effect to work. The target is immune\
      \ to this doll's Body Exchange for 24 hours after winning the Intelligence contest\
      \ or after the exchange ends."
