*Evil Toy Come to Life*

When evil energies infest a children's toy box, once-beloved playthings can become cursed monsters. Such is the case of the carrionette, an animated doll or puppet that uses its sinister magic to swap bodies with a living person.

Carrionettes can hide in plain sight amid a jumbled toy chest or crate of disused trinkets. A carrionette might wait patiently for years to be picked up by an unsuspecting victim—preferably an adventurer, a trader, or someone else with autonomy and a sturdy body—only to crawl out of the looter's backpack in the middle of the night for a harrowing sneak attack.
