A granite juggernaut is a lumbering Construct that can be found trundling across battlefields and down dungeon corridors. Granite juggernauts have dense, boxy bodies atop massive rollers they use for locomotion. Their fronts and rollers are often adorned with fearsome heads, such as those of enraged rhinos. Granite juggernauts are found on many worlds and typically are used to protect high-value locations.
