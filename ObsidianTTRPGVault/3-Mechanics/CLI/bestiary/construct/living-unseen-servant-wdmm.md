## Living Spell

Areas of wild magic and sites that have been ravaged by powerful eldritch forces can give rise to spell effects that refuse to dissipate. These so-called living spells haunt the places where they were created, subsisting on ambient magical energy.

A living spell appears much like a normal spell effect, except that its magical energy lingers and moves with purpose.

### Constructed Nature

A living spell doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Magical Essence

The process that creates a living spell changes the nature of its magic. A living spell isn't subject to [dispel magic](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md) and isn't affected by an [antimagic field](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/antimagic-field-xphb.md).

Like an overzealous butler or maid, a living [unseen servant](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/unseen-servant-xphb.md) spell busies itself with tasks in hopes of pleasing its creator. It can wield simple weapons but prefers not to. [See invisibility](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/see-invisibility-xphb.md), [true seeing](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-seeing-xphb.md), and similar effects reveal that the servant has a shape similar to that of a slender humanoid adult.
