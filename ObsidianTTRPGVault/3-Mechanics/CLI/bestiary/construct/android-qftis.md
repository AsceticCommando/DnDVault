*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 194*  

Androids are synthetic humanoids built to assist their creators with highly specialized tasks. They are designed to be compliant and typically have friendly demeanors.

Every android has one or more upgrades to help it excel at its intended functions, but all androids are capable of defending themselves with concentrated bolts of force up close or from a distance.

Despite an android's sophisticated construction, electrical surges can temporarily disrupt its finely tuned components. Similarly, damage to its core processing functions or long stretches of isolation can wear down an android's critical faculties, causing it to behave erratically.
