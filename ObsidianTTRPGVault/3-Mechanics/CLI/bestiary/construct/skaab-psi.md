Skaberen, also called stitchers, are scientist-mages who create artificial forms of life. The true goal of a skaberen is to create real life, an undertaking which usually produces a malformed "offspring" for the practitioner. This offspring is a skaab—a constructed zombie.

Skaabs are assembled from disparate body parts and animated through scientific means. Most skaabs are more or less humanlike, but creative stitchers have crafted winged skaabs similar to the drakes of other worlds, towering giant skaabs, and unrecognizable horrors.

Skaberen go through an elaborate process to gather body parts, bind them together, infuse the stitched body with vital fluid, and plant a vital force in its unliving flesh. Some skaberen even use necro-alchemy to fuel their laboratories, leading to even more confusion in terminology.

Skaberen usually ply their trade in remote and inhospitable places, since they are viewed as blasphemers by the church of Avacyn. They often become obsessed hermits who surround themselves with ancient scrolls and books, phials of rare noxious liquids, glass jars full of pickled organs, anatomical charts for both humans and beasts, rune-engraved skeletal remains, and small anvils and hammers for inscribing brass and copper plates.

Some skaberen might be mere [commoners](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner-xmm.md), or perhaps [cultists](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cultist-xmm.md). The most powerful among them might be [mages](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage-xmm.md) (using geist-powered devices), but the true power of most skaberen is in their creations ([flesh golems](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/skaab-psi.md)), not their own magic.
