# [Octon Modron](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/octon-modron-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 40*  

At the head of Mechanus's sectors are the octons, hierarch modrons that oversee daily governance. They provide data to other hierarchs, such as productivity reports to septons and diagnostic data to decatons. Octons have eight mechanical tentacles which they use to manipulate objects and defend themselves, spinning them in a bludgeoning whirlwind.

## Modrons

Constructed on the plane of Mechanus, modrons are partially mechanical beings that belong to a strict hierarchy. Each modron dutifully obeys commands from the rank directly above it and in turn acts as the superior to the rank directly below it, passing down commands from paragons of law to the lowliest monodrone. While most modrons are the lower-ranked base modrons—monodrones, duodrones, tridrones, quadrones, and pentadrones—the upper-tier hierarch modrons hold leadership positions, maintaining order in Mechanus and the realms beyond. For more information on modrons, see the *Monster Manual*.
