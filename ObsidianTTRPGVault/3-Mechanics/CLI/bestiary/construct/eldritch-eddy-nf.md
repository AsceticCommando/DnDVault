# [Eldritch Eddy](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/eldritch-eddy-nf.md)
*Source: Netheril's Fall*  

When magical energy becomes dangerously unstable, it sometimes animates into an eldritch eddy: an uncontrolled whirlwind of Evocation magic that crackles with fire and lightning. Eldritch eddies typically arise where magic use is heavy and irresponsible, such as near a fanatical mage's sanctum, a workshop that churns out magic items, or a library where undertrained scribes work with Spell Scrolls. Eldritch eddies are common in ancient Netheril near the homes and workplaces of famous mages.

Eldritch eddies rampage with one purpose: destroy as much in their paths as possible. Before eldritch eddies manifest, telltale signs signal their arrival. Roll on or choose a result from the Eldritch Eddy Manifestations table to inspire what happens right before an eldritch eddy arises.

| dice: 1d6 | Right Before an Eddy Manifests... |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| 1 | Brightly colored sparks fly through the air like fireworks. |
| 2 | Spectral images of screaming mages or terrible beasts swirl in a whirlwind. |
| 3 | Electricity flashes, flames ignite, and the air smells acrid. |
| 4 | Purple smoke billows into a vortex. |
| 5 | A geyser of multicolored light shoots from the ground toward the sky. |
| 6 | The air shimmers, and unsettling laughter booms from all directions. |
