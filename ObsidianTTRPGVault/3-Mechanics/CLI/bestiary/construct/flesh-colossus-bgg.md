# [Flesh Colossus](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/flesh-colossus-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 141*  

During the dawn of the giants' empires, twisted minds sought to make their fallen comrades continue their service. Wizard giants stitched and wove the flesh of various giants over an adamantine skeleton, creating a grisly colossal construct. Inside the flesh colossus's chest is a stone sphere infused with spirits from each elemental plane acting as its core.

To this day, some of these ancient flesh colossi guard abandoned ruins, sites sacred to giants, and lost treasures—and possibly the procedure to create new examples of their kind.
