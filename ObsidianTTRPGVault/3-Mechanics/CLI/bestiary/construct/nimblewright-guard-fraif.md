# [Nimblewright Guard](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/nimblewright-guard-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 266*  

Watchful sentries that patrol important sites, nimblewright guards serve as loyal soldiers or work as vigilant bodyguards.

## Nimblewrights

*Cunningly Crafted Clockwork Sentinels*

Nimblewrights are fabricated from durable wood and animated by magic and clockwork gears. Some nimblewrights bear metal plates to protect their cogs and springs, while others have their workings exposed. No mere automatons, nimblewrights can form rudimentary plans and adapt their routines to account for dangers.

Nimblewrights are surprisingly dexterous for creations made of animated wood and metal. A nimblewright walks with a flowing grace and fights with whirling pirouettes.

Nimblewrights can serve as interesting background flavor in Calimshan or other areas where they are common. Roll or choose a result from the Nimblewright Tasks table as inspiration for what a nimblewright guard or nimblewright hulk might be doing in a busy public place.
