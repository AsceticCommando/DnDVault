# [Alyxian the Hunter](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/alyxian-the-hunter-crcotn.md)
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 160*  

This ruidium golem resembles Alyxian the Apotheon. It remains as rigid as a statue until the characters attack it or until Theo vanishes from the Netherdeep.
