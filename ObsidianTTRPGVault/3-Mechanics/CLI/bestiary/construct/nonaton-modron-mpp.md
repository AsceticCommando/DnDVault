# [Nonaton Modron](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/nonaton-modron-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 38*  

When modrons act against the will of Primus, nonatons are charged with bringing those rogue units into line. These inspectors also interrogate captured trespassers of Mechanus. Nonatons have wormlike bodies studded with nine mechanical arms.

## Modrons

Constructed on the plane of Mechanus, modrons are partially mechanical beings that belong to a strict hierarchy. Each modron dutifully obeys commands from the rank directly above it and in turn acts as the superior to the rank directly below it, passing down commands from paragons of law to the lowliest monodrone. While most modrons are the lower-ranked base modrons—monodrones, duodrones, tridrones, quadrones, and pentadrones—the upper-tier hierarch modrons hold leadership positions, maintaining order in Mechanus and the realms beyond. For more information on modrons, see the *Monster Manual*.
