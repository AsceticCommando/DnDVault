  - "desc": "A creature can grab the staff out of the air with a successful grapple\
      \ check against the staff, and grappling the staff does not reduce the creature's\
      \ speed. Any creature that successfully grapples the staff must succeed on a\
      \ DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ by the staff until the staff is no longer in its grasp. While the creature\
      \ is [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), the staff can issue\
      \ commands to it, which the creature does its best to obey. The creature can\
      \ repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage, ending the effect on itself\
      \ on a success. A creature that successfully resists the staff's control can't\
      \ be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by it for 24 hours.\n\
      \nA creature holding the staff that isn't [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ by it can use an action to attempt to break the staff over a knee or against\
      \ a solid surface, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\
      \ check. Breaking the staff in this manner destroys it."

  - "desc": "The staff has 10 charges. It can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast\
      \ one of the following spells (save DC 12): [cone of cold](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold-xphb.md)\
      \ (5 charges), [fog cloud](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud-xphb.md) (1 charge),\

      \ of ice](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-ice-xphb.md) (4 charges). It regains\
      \ 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If the staff expends its last charge,\
      \ roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed."
