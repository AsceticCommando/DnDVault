# [Warforged Titan](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/warforged-titan-erlw.md)
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 315*  

Warforged titans are hulking constructs built to wreak paths of destruction through enemy armies. Some of the most feared combatants of the Last War, warforged titans are barely sentient, with just enough intelligence to follow commands.

## Legacy of Giants

In the Age of Giants, giant artificers built mindless war golems to aid them in their war against the quori. Millennia later, some of these golems were unearthed by adventurers searching for the secrets of that age, then turned over to artificers working for the dragonmarked houses during the Last War. House Cannith studied these designs, and in the course of uncovering the secrets of the golems and the giant artificers who made them, House Cannith created the first warforged titans.
