      \ tentacles as well as its main body. Each tentacle can be attacked independently,\
      \ with damage dealt to tentacles applied to the clockwork kraken's hit point\
      \ total. A tentacle is destroyed if it takes more than 20 damage.\n\nReducing\
      \ the construct to three or fewer tentacles reduces its attacks accordingly.\
