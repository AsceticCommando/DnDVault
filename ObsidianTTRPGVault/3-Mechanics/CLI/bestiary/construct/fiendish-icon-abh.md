# [Fiendish Icon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/fiendish-icon-abh.md)
*Source: Astarion's Book of Hungers p. 14*  

*Effigy Animated by Hellish Magic*

Fiendish icons are grotesque, sapient statues depicting fearsome fiends. These creatures gain life as a result of sinister rituals. Fiendish icons can explode with hellfire to roast their foes, and they often pretend to be ordinary statues until they leap up to ambush invaders.

Roll on or choose a result from the Fiendish Icon Appearances table to inspire what a particular fiendish icon resembles.
