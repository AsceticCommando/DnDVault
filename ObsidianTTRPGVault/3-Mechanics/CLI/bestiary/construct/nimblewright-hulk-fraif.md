# [Nimblewright Hulk](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/nimblewright-hulk-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 267*  

Nimblewright hulks are massive guards or sentinels. These four-armed Constructs often have thick steel bolted to their frames. They are neither slow nor stupid, to the surprise of many would-be thieves or trespassers.

## Nimblewrights

*Cunningly Crafted Clockwork Sentinels*

Nimblewrights are fabricated from durable wood and animated by magic and clockwork gears. Some nimblewrights bear metal plates to protect their cogs and springs, while others have their workings exposed. No mere automatons, nimblewrights can form rudimentary plans and adapt their routines to account for dangers.

Nimblewrights are surprisingly dexterous for creations made of animated wood and metal. A nimblewright walks with a flowing grace and fights with whirling pirouettes.

Nimblewrights can serve as interesting background flavor in Calimshan or other areas where they are common. Roll or choose a result from the Nimblewright Tasks table as inspiration for what a nimblewright guard or nimblewright hulk might be doing in a busy public place.
