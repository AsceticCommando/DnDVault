# [Maschin-i-Bozorg](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/maschin-i-bozorg-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 207*  

The kagu-svirfneblin's most prized invention is the maschin-i-bozorg: a dome-shaped, steam-powered battle construct propelled by a multitude of wheels along its flat underside. Maschin-i-bozorgs typically act as guardians and sentries, tirelessly patrolling the sites they're assigned to protect. Each machine obeys the commands of its creator.

A machin-i-bozorg can roll over its enemies to crush them with its immense weight. It can also fire poison darts with deadly precision, jab creatures with similar darts attached to extendable arms that retract inside its body, and spray jets of scalding steam to fend off intruders.
