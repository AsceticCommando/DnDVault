      \ (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have\
      \ only one creature swallowed at a time.\n\nIf the behir takes 30 damage or\
      \ more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed\
      \ on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate\
      \ the creature, which falls [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
      \ in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature\
      \ is no longer [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting\
      \ [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
