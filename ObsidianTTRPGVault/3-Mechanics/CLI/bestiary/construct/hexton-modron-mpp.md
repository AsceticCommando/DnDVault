# [Hexton Modron](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/hexton-modron-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 37*  

When the armies of Mechanus mobilize against the forces of chaos, hextons are the field generals who command modron troops. These hulking hierarchs lead groups of modrons in endeavors outside Mechanus, with the most notable example being the Great Modron March. Hextons have solid frames that bristle with six shining flanges. They boast a pair of arms and tentacles, both of which end in powerful pincers.

## Modrons

Constructed on the plane of Mechanus, modrons are partially mechanical beings that belong to a strict hierarchy. Each modron dutifully obeys commands from the rank directly above it and in turn acts as the superior to the rank directly below it, passing down commands from paragons of law to the lowliest monodrone. While most modrons are the lower-ranked base modrons—monodrones, duodrones, tridrones, quadrones, and pentadrones—the upper-tier hierarch modrons hold leadership positions, maintaining order in Mechanus and the realms beyond. For more information on modrons, see the *Monster Manual*.
