    "name": "Acid Absorption"
  - "desc": "Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, roll\
      \ a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk,\
      \ the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near\
      \ enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference\

      \ on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced\
      \ by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces\
      \ its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the [greater\
