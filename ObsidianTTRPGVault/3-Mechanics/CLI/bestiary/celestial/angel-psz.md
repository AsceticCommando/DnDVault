# [Angel](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/angel-psz.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 21*  

The angels of Zendikar are living manifestations of white mana, and they embody its inherent tendencies toward morality and order. Peace and harmony are their goals, though they are more concerned with reestablishing the natural order of the plane than with interfering in disputes between the lowly mortal races. Angels appear similar to female humans possessing two, four, or six feathered wings. Their eyes glow with inner light, and glowing golden rings surround their heads—usually positioned to cover their eyes.

Zendikar's people consider the angels to be aloof but benevolent. Their resistance to the Eldrazi broods in the ancient past is vaguely remembered in the myths of the humans, kor, and merfolk. Humans in particular venerate angels as divine protectors because of those myths.

You can represent most angels in Zendikar using the [deva](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/deva-xmm.md) in the Monster Manual. For unique or more powerful angels, you can use the [planetar](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/planetar-xmm.md) or [solar](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/solar-xmm.md) instead. Perhaps [Linvala](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/linvala-psz.md) is a [planetar](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/planetar-xmm.md) and [Iona](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/iona-psz.md) is a [solar](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/solar-xmm.md).
