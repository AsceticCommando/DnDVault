# [Ferrumach Rilmani](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/ferrumach-rilmani-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 44*  

Ferrumachs are the foot soldiers of the rilmani, preserving the balance between the planes through martial force. They vigilantly defend the Spire and fight at the command of aurumachs to protect the neutrality of the multiverse. Ferrumachs gleam with the sheen of bare iron. Their bodies are honed to razor edges, and from it they can fling bolts of sharpened metal.

## Rilmani

Rilmani protect the balance between the forces and philosophies of the multiverse. They seek to maintain planar equilibrium, assuring that good, evil, law, or chaos never grow too powerful or too weak. To the rilmani, each of these forces is fundamental to the multiverse's existence. Whenever one threatens to tip the balance in its favor or a plane is on the verge of collapse, the rilmani act to even the odds.

While the rilmani might be found anywhere, they're most frequently encountered on their home plane, the Outlands, where they work to ensure that no force overexerts itself on the Concordant Opposition.

Rilmani are bipedal, with bodies of living metal that ranges in appearance from cold iron to brilliant gold. Most have smooth faces with few features, and their extraordinary anatomies often act in defiance of natural forces.
