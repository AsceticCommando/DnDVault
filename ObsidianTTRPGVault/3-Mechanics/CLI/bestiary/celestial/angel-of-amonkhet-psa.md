# [Angel of Amonkhet](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/angel-of-amonkhet-psa.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 30*  

Whatever their original forms might have been, the angels of Amonkhet have been twisted into distorted reflections of Nicol Bolas. Their limbs are long and thin, with elongated shins and forearms. Their huge wings are adorned with white and black feathers. Light shines through their joints and chests as if from an internal fire, and their eyes glow with a gold or orange light.

Bolas's angels are his personal agents during his absence from Amonkhet. Their mission, which they pursue with unwavering devotion, is to keep Naktamun free of dissenting voices. They stand as sentinels over the city, extending supernatural senses to detect the presence of dissenters. They use their long, hooked [staffs](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/staff-xphb.md) to capture those who question the God-Pharaoh's rule, and are tasked with carrying out the punishment that Bolas's law demands. Dissenters are bound into sarcophagi—the Tombs of Disgrace—and exposed to the mockery of fellow citizens in the Display of Doubt. On the following morning, the angels carry the sarcophagi into the desert and abandon the dissenters to the horrors of the sands—and the Curse of Wandering.

Use the statistics of a [deva](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/deva-xmm.md) for an angel on Amonkhet, replacing its mace attack with a staff attack. When the angel hits with a melee attack using its staff, the target is [grappled](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) and the angel can't attack another target with its staff.
