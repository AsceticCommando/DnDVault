# [Aurumach Rilmani](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/aurumach-rilmani-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 43*  

From redoubts near the Spire in the Outlands, aurumachs oversee the preservation of the cosmic status quo, serving as leaders and strategists of the rilmani. Employing mysterious magic, occult calculations, and networks of informants, aurumachs monitor forces across the planes. Only when planar balance is under threat of total collapse do these elusive, gold-skinned beings leave the Outlands, manifesting gleaming blades to destroy those that threaten multiversal stability.

## Rilmani

Rilmani protect the balance between the forces and philosophies of the multiverse. They seek to maintain planar equilibrium, assuring that good, evil, law, or chaos never grow too powerful or too weak. To the rilmani, each of these forces is fundamental to the multiverse's existence. Whenever one threatens to tip the balance in its favor or a plane is on the verge of collapse, the rilmani act to even the odds.

While the rilmani might be found anywhere, they're most frequently encountered on their home plane, the Outlands, where they work to ensure that no force overexerts itself on the Concordant Opposition.

Rilmani are bipedal, with bodies of living metal that ranges in appearance from cold iron to brilliant gold. Most have smooth faces with few features, and their extraordinary anatomies often act in defiance of natural forces.
