# [Archon of Boundaries](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/archon-of-boundaries-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

The archons of Eldraine are enigmatic beings who fly over the perimeter where the realm meets the wilds, marking the boundary between safety (for the people of the realm) and danger. The sight of an archon overhead is a clear signal that one is entering the wilds.

An archon appears as a hooded, spectral rider mounted on a winged elk with glowing antlers and gleaming eyes. Despite this appearance, rider and mount are a single creature that can't be separated. Tales say that archons are ascended spirits of paladins fused with the celestial spirits of their steeds, returned from the celestial realms to watch over the boundary of the wilds and protect those who dare to cross it.

Sometimes knights of the realm get the idea that they can expand the borders of their land and keep the wilds at bay simply by driving archons deeper into the wilds. Such efforts are futile; not only are archons difficult to kill, but they don't create the boundaries, merely mark them.
