# [Archon of Redemption](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/archon-of-redemption-psz.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 22*  

Like angels, archons are incarnations of white mana. They serve the archangels as embodiments of white mana's harsher aspects: a rigid sense of justice and a ruthless execution of punishment for those who defy the law. The appearance of the archons is deceptive: they look like hooded humans riding winged lions, but they are single creatures with just one mind and will.

An archon's game statistics are nearly identical to those of a [deva](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/deva-xmm.md).
