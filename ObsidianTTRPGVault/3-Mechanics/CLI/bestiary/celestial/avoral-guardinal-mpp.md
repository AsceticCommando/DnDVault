*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 32*  

Avorals are eagle-like bipeds with winged arms and keen, golden eyes. Prone to wander, these avian Celestials leave Elysium more frequently than their counterparts, meandering across the Outlands to wherever the winds might take them. Solitary scouts and skirmishers, avorals are nimble aerial combatants, able to swiftly dive at foes from the heavens and tear into them with razor-sharp talons.

## Guardinals

Nomadic and peaceful, guardinals are animalistic Celestials who hail from Elysium. Guardinals resemble Humanoids with bestial traits. In their daily interactions, guardinals embody the beauty, calm, and righteousness of their home plane. Guardinals can be found throughout the Outlands, especially in Ecstasy, the gate-town to Elysium, and in Faunel, the gate-town to the Beastlands.

While guardinals are usually friendly and slow to anger, their supernatural virtue puts them at odds with the evil beings of the Lower Planes. Guardinals abhor wickedness and strike out against injustice and villainy without hesitation, determined to eradicate forces that threaten beauty and peace.
