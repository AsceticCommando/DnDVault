*Source: Turn of Fortune's Wheel p. 88*  

Gzemnid is a beholder god of deception, gases, and obscurement.

The realm of the beholder deity Gzemnid lies beneath the Outlands. Most entrances into these mysterious, gas-filled caverns are found near chaotically aligned gate-towns—like Bedlam, Sylvania, or Xaos—but Gzemnid's Realm is elusive, even by the mutable standards of the Outlands.
