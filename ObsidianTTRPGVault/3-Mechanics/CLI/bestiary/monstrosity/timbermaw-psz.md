*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 34*  

Timbermaws dwell in the hollow trunks of strange floating trees, emerging with deadly speed when prey wanders near. (The [grick](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/grick-xmm.md) statistics can represent a timbermaw, adjusting its stone camouflage trait to hide it in the woodlands.)
