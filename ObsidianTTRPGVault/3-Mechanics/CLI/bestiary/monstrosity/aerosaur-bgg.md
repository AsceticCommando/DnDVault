# [Aerosaur](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/aerosaur-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 128*  

A pterosaur the size of the most ancient dragons, an aerosaur boasts a wingspan of nearly 200 feet. Elemental energy traces patterns like lightning across its scales, giving additional thunderous power to the beating of its enormous wings.

## Dinosaurs

When Annam's children first began to populate the worlds of the Material Plane, the All-Father created behemoth dinosaurs to live alongside them as companions. The primeval magic used to create the dinosaurs still thrums through their being and manifests in colorful, scar-like lines on their towering bodies. Some of these ancient dinosaurs persist in timeless jungles, hidden enclaves, and other lands untouched by the rest of the world.
