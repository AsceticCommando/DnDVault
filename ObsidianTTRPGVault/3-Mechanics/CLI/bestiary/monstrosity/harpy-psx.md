# [Harpy](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy-psx.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Ixalan p. 36*  

Harpies are the mortal servants of demons, and they resemble them in their general features. Their faces are like those of owls, and they have large, feathered wings that suggest their corrupt connection to the Sun Empire—or perhaps their heritage as sirens who were corrupted by the evil of the demons. Utterly nasty in temperament, harpies inhabit many of the islands in both the Stormwreck Sea and the Inner Sea, and dwell on high cliffs on the mainland of Ixalan. Their filthy bodies carry disease that they can spread through their bite.

Use the [harpy](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy-xmm.md) statistics in the "Monster Manual" for Ixalan's harpies, but replace the club attack with a bite attack.

## Night Terrors

The legends of the Sun Empire are populated with the enemies of the sun—terrible monsters that threaten to devour its light and undo its work. Unfortunately for the people of Ixalan, these are not just creatures of legend but real monsters with supernatural power, lurking in the darkness of night and the shadows of ancient ruins and crypts.

      \ turn toward the harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity\
      \ attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and\
      \ whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, a target can\
      \ repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the\
      \ end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the\
      \ effect ends on it.\n\nA target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's\
