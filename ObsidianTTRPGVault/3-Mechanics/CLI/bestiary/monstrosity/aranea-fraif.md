## Aranea

*Secretive Crafter and Trader*

Araneas are reclusive shape-shifters. An aranea's natural form resembles a bulky, humpbacked spider with two short arms beneath its head. An aranea can shape-shift into a humanoid form or into a multi-armed humanoid-spider hybrid. Araneas live in insular communities, such as the Spider Swamp in Calimshan, where they create beautiful objects that express their artistry and which are sometimes traded to other communities. Most araneas prefer to avoid combat, befuddling their foes long enough to skitter to safety.

Roll or choose a result from the Aranea Crafts table as inspiration for an aranea's crafting talent.
