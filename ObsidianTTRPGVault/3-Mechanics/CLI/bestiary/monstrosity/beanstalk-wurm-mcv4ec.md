# [Beanstalk Wurm](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/beanstalk-wurm-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Wurms are enormous creatures that resemble limbless, wingless dragons, though they lack a dragon's breath weapons and keen intelligence. On the world of Eldraine, many wurms have adapted to life among the world's skyscraping beanstalks. These beanstalk wurms sport leafy growths, sustaining themselves on a mixture of natural photosynthesis and a carnivorous diet.

Cloud-dwelling giants often use beanstalk wurms as a first line of defense against those who would ascend massive beanstalks—also known as Everstalks—to intrude on their lofty palaces. Beanstalk wurms lie coiled along the length of an Everstalk with their eyes closed and their stomach flattened against the stalk, appearing to be just another enormous vine until a tasty intruder attempts to climb them.
