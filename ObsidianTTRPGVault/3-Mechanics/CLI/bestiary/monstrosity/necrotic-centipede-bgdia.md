      \ end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
      \ in a space within 10 feet of the centipede. If the centipede dies, a swallowed\
      \ creature is no longer [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
