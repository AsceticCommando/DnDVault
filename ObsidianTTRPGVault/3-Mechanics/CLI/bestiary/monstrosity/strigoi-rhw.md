*Magically Mutated Bloodsucker*

Strigoi are vampire-like beings that resemble half-humanoid, half-stirge terrors. By night, these bloodthirsty predators seek humanoids to feed on, draining victims and leaving behind bloodless corpses. Stirges and mosquitoes follow these repulsive monsters in their hunts.
