# [Hydra](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra-psk.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Kaladesh p. 30*  

Hydras are giant lizards resembling iguanas, with multiple heads set atop long, snakelike necks. Aether traces whorling patterns through their scales, shapes the crests running down their necks and tails, and glows blue within the skin under their chins. Most hydras have five or six heads, but small hydras with as few as three heads—as well as enormous specimens with eight or more—have been seen in the deep forests far from Ghirapur.

Hydras are fierce predators, favoring prey that has absorbed large quantities of aether from the environment. This taste for aether also leads them to devour aether-powered machines whenever they encounter such devices, from thopters to automatons. In the remote wilderness near Peema where hydras are plentiful, such altercations are rarely an issue. But in the rare event of a hydra coming too close to civilization—or even wandering into one of Ghirapur's greenbelts—they can cause widespread destruction in their hunt for aether.
