# [Creeper](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/creeper-mcv3mc.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: Minecraft Creatures p. 4*  

A creeper is a green, armless creature that emerges in darkness and silently prowls the Overworld on its four short legs. Its peculiar face bears no clue of its motives, but its destructiveness makes it one of the greatest threats to both life and property in the Overworld.

A creeper quietly shuffles toward Humanoid prey. When it gets close enough, it halts and begins to hiss like a burning fuse. Unless the creeper is defeated or its target gets far enough away that the creeper defuses itself, the creeper explodes a few short moments later, leaving a crater where it once stood.

Creepers have an uncanny ability to appear when least expected, and few places are safe from their explosive nature. Yet creepers have one strange weakness: they fear cats and do all they can to avoid them.

If a creeper is struck by lightning, rather than being harmed, it becomes charged with electrical power. In this charged state, the creeper gains a bluish aura and can explode with even greater power.

      \ within 30 feet of itself.\n\nIf the creeper drops to 0 hit points before the\

      \n- If there are no Humanoids within 10 feet of the hissing creeper, it stops\
      \ hissing. It then uses any available movement to approach the nearest Humanoid\
      \ it can see.  \n- If there are one or more Humanoids within 10 feet of the\
      \ hissing creeper, the creeper explodes in a ball of energy that fills a 20-foot-radius\
      \ sphere centered on itself. This energy spreads around corners. The creeper\
      \ is destroyed, and every other creature in the explosion's area must make a\
      \ DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failed\
      \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Increase this damage by\
      \ 7 (2d6) if the creeper is charged (see \"Electrical Charge\" below). Objects\
      \ in the area that aren't being worn or carried take 14 (4d6) lightning damage,\
