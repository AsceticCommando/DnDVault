*Source: RHW p. 252*  

*Legendary Lycanthrope*

Loup garou are powerful lycanthropes capable of transforming into hulking dire wolves. They actively seek to spread the curse of lycanthropy, creating packs of subservient werewolves that can reduce communities to ruins and ravage whole regions. The strain of lycanthropy spread by a loup garou is harder to cure than typical varieties. Only slaying a loup garou can free the monster's victims from their affliction.
