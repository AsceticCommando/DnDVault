*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 237*  

Happy to watch its flock squabble over carrion in Tammeraut's Fate, this gray-feathered matron of the harpies is surrounded by a cloud of magical spirits resembling skeletal seabirds.

      \ terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source\
      \ other than the matriarch, the target can repeat the saving throw. A [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
