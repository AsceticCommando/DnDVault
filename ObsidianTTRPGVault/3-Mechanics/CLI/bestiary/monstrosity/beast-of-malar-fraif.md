## Beast of Malar

*Ferocious, Shape-Changing Predator*

Malar, god of the bestial hunt, sometimes manifests a spark of primal predation in physical form: the beast of Malar. The beast of Malar can take three types of forms—a land form, a sea form, and a sky form—to pursue prey across land, seas, and skies. In each form, its short fur is glossy black with red fur around its jaws and claws as though stained by the blood it has spilled.

The beast of Malar has a muscular and unnatural appearance no matter its form; whether it resembles a bat, wolverine, or shark, there's no mistaking the beast of Malar for a mundane animal. The beast shifts easily between its forms to pursue its prey, using whichever shape suits it best to catch and kill its quarry.

Normally only one beast of Malar exists at a time. However, Malar might create multiple beasts to pursue legendary prey or simply display his extraordinary ferocity.
