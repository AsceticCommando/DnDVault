# [Wurm](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/wurm-psz.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 32*  

The wurms of Zendikar are gigantic creatures with features akin to both snakes and insects. A wurm's serpentine body is covered in heavy bands of scales, giving it a segmented appearance. Its misshapen head is crowned with at least eight eyes, and is dominated by a ring of four or five enormous, hook-like fangs surrounding the mouth. The creature's jaws extend like a tube out from its mouth when it is ready to feed, accompanied by a horrendous carrion stench and a nauseating squelching sound.

The [purple worm](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm-xmm.md) in the Monster Manual is a fine representation of Zendikar's wurms.
