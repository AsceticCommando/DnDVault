# [Chupacabra](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/chupacabra-psx.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Ixalan p. 9*  

Indescribable creatures of nightmare lurk in the ruins and dark places of Ixalan. Many are thought to be the corrupted remnants of the life energy and brilliant light left behind in places the Sun Empire has abandoned. Such creatures include a monster that lurks in the darkness of the jungle and feeds on the blood of mammals and dinosaurs, called the chupacabra. It is stealthy and elusive, known more by the blood-drained prey it leaves behind than by actual physical sightings.

## Night Terrors

The legends of the Sun Empire are populated with the enemies of the sun—terrible monsters that threaten to devour its light and undo its work. Unfortunately for the people of Ixalan, these are not just creatures of legend but real monsters with supernatural power, lurking in the darkness of night and the shadows of ancient ruins and crypts.
