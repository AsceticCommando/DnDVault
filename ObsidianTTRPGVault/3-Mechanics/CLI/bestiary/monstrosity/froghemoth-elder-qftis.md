# [Froghemoth Elder](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/froghemoth-elder-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 198*  

Froghemoths are massive amphibious predators with starry origins. A froghemoth has four tentacles, a rubbery hide, a long prehensile tongue, and three bulbous eyes branching from an extendable stalk.

Though most froghemoths lurk in swamps, those raised in unnatural environs—as well as those that dine on smaller, weaker hatchlings—are unmatched in strength and hunger. These ancient specimens, known as froghemoth elders, possess alien abilities and warp the ecosystems in which they dwell.

To learn more about froghemoths, see *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse*.

## A Froghemoth Elder's Lair

Froghemoth elders lair in unnatural ecosystems that facilitate their growth, such as wrecked spaceships, primordial bogs, and radioactive pools.
