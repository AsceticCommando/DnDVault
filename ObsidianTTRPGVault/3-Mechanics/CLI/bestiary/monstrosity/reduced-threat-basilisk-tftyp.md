  - "desc": "If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the\
      \ two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make\
      \ a DC 10 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).\
      \ On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
      \ It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success,\
      \ the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified)\
      \ until freed by the [greater restoration](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md)\
      \ spell or other magic.\n\nA creature that isn't [surprised](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised)\
      \ can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If\
      \ it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when\
      \ it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime,\
      \ it must immediately make the save.\n\nIf the basilisk sees its reflection\
      \ within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets\
      \ itself with its gaze."
