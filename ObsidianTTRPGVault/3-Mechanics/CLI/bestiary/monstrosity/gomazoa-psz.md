# [Gomazoa](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/gomazoa-psz.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 26*  

Zendikar's seas and skies tend to blur together, and creatures typically found in the sea often find their way to the clouds, gliding through the plane's gravitational currents by consuming the mana infused in the wind. The windrider eels hunted by the kor and the cloud mantas sometimes ridden by Emeria-creed merfolk are two examples. The gomazoas found in Murasa and the Makindi Trenches are another.

Gomazoas are similar to aquatic jellyfish, but their bodies are encased in stony growths. A gomazoa drifts motionless among floating rocks or hedrons with its long, sticky tentacles dangling below. When they brush against another creature, those tentacles grab and constrict it, or might slam larger prey against a cliff face. Some species can withdraw their tentacles into their bodies, extending them only to grab their prey. Gomazoas almost never release prey once they've caught it.

A gomazoa might be represented by the [roper](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/roper-xmm.md) statistics in the *Monster Manual*, with a flying speed of 10 feet in place of its walking and climbing speeds.
