*Ominous Shape-Shifter*

Wereravens are secretive, cautious lycanthropes that seek to blend into society and subtly combat evil. To avoid the claws of the wicked forces that oppose them, and to protect those they hold dear, wereravens hide their identities and rarely reveal their hybrid forms. Nevertheless, folktales persist of eerie, raven-winged figures who appear prior to disasters, share mysterious prophecies, and aid hapless victims. Such stories are true in a way, as evil hunts wereravens wherever they go.

Because evil frequently travels in packs, wereravens flock together to battle such threats. They congregate in hard-to-reach aeries within or just outside urban settlements, such as atop bell towers, lighthouses, or ancient trees. Wereraven groups tend to be loosely organized, since members understand the importance of anonymity.

The Keepers of the Feather) is one example of a secret society of evil-opposing wereravens.
