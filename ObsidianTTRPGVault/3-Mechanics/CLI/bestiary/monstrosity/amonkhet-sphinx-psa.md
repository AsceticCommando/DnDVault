# [Amonkhet Sphinx](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/amonkhet-sphinx-psa.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 31*  

Sphinxes are inscrutable beings, and keepers of secrets and mysteries. They have leonine bodies, hawk-like wings, and faces resembling humans, framed by great frills or manes of feathers. Their powerful forearms are also feathered, and fans of long feathers form their tails.

The sphinxes of Amonkhet are perhaps the only creatures to remain uncorrupted by the influence of Nicol Bolas on this plane. Their impenetrable minds proved to be beyond even Bolas's ability to control—but even so, he was able to place them under a curse to guarantee their silence. A sphinx is utterly incapable of communication—verbal or nonverbal, even written—as long as the curse remains in effect. In this way, Bolas has prevented the sphinxes from revealing his system of lies to the people or gods of Naktamun.

Use the statistics of an [androsphinx](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/sphinx-of-valor-xmm.md) for the common sphinxes of Amonkhet.
