The dread doppelganger is an ancient member of that race. It has lived for centuries adopting the forms of hundreds or even thousands of different creatures. The long years of impersonating others has drained these elder beings of any kind of empathy. Most dread doppelgangers work alone, though sometimes they will lead a band of younger members of their kind.

## Emotionless

Dread doppelgangers have impersonated the feelings and emotions of so many others that they find it difficult to feel emotions of their own. Because of this they make excellent spies and assassins, for they don't experience remorse for anything that they might have to do. Dread doppelgangers seek out increasingly risky and bizarre behavior in order to instill any kind of emotion. Often this means they will take on dangerous jobs that could bring about their own death.

## Unnatural Gait

In their natural form dread doppelgangers move about in a disturbing fashion. They are so used to mimicking the movements of others that their own manner of moving seems broken and chaotic. While they might seem ungainly and clumsy when they move, they can lash out at speeds that often surprise their victims.
