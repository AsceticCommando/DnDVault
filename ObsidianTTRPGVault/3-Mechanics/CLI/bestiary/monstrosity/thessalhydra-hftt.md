*Source: Hunt for the Thessalhydra p. 41*  

The thessalhydra is a strange and terrible creature with eight heads surrounding a large, circular mouth rimmed with jagged teeth. Its maw drips with acid, and its tail ends with a pair of sharp pincers. The thessalhydra is gluttonous and damaging to any environment.
