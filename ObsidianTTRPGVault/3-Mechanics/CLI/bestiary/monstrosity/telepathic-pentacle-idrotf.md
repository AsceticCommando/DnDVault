*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 244*  

Months before Ythryn's fall, a circle of mages known as the Telepathic Pentacle tried to fuse their minds together to become a conjoined telepathic force. The procedure went terribly wrong, and their bodies and minds melded into a single monstrosity. Iriolarthas imprisoned the thing in this empty well so that its latent telepathic powers could be tapped by the city's elite. A short obituary is engraved around the lip of the well in Draconic: "Herein lie the immortal remains of the Telepathic Pentacle. Sit, meditate, and learn."
