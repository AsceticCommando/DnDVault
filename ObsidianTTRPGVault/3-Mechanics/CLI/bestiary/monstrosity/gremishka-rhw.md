*Magic-Reactive Mage Killer*

Gremishkas are magically unstable creations of misguided magic-users. These wildly destructive menaces delight in tormenting spellcasters and seek to destroy anything associated with them, particularly spellbooks, spell components, and familiars. If exposed to magic, a lone gremishka explodes into a destructive swarm of duplicate gremishkas.
