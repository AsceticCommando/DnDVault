# [Wurm](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/wurm-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 225*  

Wurms are huge creatures that resemble limbless, wingless dragons. They burrow through the earth and eat virtually anything they come across, and their movement accounts for much of the destruction in the rubblebelt regions of Ravnica. A wurm burrows through loose earth by using deep sonic vibrations to liquefy the earth in front of it and swim through the area. The soil resolidifies and closes behind it. Moving through rock is slower and more difficult, and the wurm leaves a tunnel in its wake. The Gruul Clans appreciate the devastation wurms can create, and the clans sometimes lure them into civilized areas where the destruction can be vast.
