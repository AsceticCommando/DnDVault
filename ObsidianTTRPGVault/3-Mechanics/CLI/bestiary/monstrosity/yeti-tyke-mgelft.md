# [Yeti Tyke](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/yeti-tyke-mgelft.md)
*Source: Muk's Guide To Everything He Learned From Tasha p. 34*  

This family of yetis don't normally venture down to the Dankwood. Their home is in the frosty, Snowy Hills up north, where the air is cool and their fluffy-white fur makes for perfect camouflage.

A yeti tyke who has been separated from its family is scared, hungry and looking for a friendly face. Its loud, sorrowful howls will be a sure-fire way to locate where it's currently hiding.

To coax the scared yeti tyke out, you might try the following:

- Yetis have an amazing sense of smell and a smelly snack might do the trick!  
- You might not speak the same language, but some well-pitched yeti howls and yeti hand motions are sure to show that you mean no harm. (Make sure you show how it's done!)  
- This yeti tyke is missing its family, is there a way to disguise yourself as a long-lost yeti relative?
