# [Snapping Hydra](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/snapping-hydra-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

A rare variety of hydra native to the wilds of Eldraine, snapping hydras resemble giant, many-headed turtles. Snapping hydras dwell at the bottom of the wild's largest lakes, or along shorelines where the wilds meet the ocean. These monstrous creatures are aptly named; their bites are known to snap giants' arms cleanly in half.

Snapping hydras have naturally long life spans and strong instincts of self-preservation. When a snapping hydra feels a battle's odds tipping out of its favor, the hydra lets out a raspy screech and retracts into its shell. In the wilds of Eldraine, it's never long before a hungry or curious creature arrives to investigate, leaping into battle with the hydra's foes while the hydra makes an opportune exit.
