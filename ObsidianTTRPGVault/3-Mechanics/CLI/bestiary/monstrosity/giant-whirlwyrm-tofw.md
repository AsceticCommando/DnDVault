      \ must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn\
      \ or regurgitate the creature, which falls [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
      \ in a space within 10 feet of the whirlwyrm. If the whirlwyrm dies, a swallowed\
      \ creature is no longer [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting\
      \ [prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
