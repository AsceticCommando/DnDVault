  - "desc": "When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within\
      \ 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution\
      \ saving throw if the medusa isn't [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature\
      \ is instantly [petrified](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified). Otherwise,\
      \ a creature that fails the save begins to turn to metal, wood, or porcelain\
      \ (the medusa's choice) and is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
      \ The [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature\
      \ must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [petrified](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified)\
      \ on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until\
      \ the creature is freed by the [greater restoration](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md)\
      \ spell or other magic.\n\nUnless [surprised](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised),\
      \ a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its\
      \ turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of\
      \ its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at\
      \ the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\n\nIf the medusa\
      \ sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an\
      \ area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own\
      \ gaze."
