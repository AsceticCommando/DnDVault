# [Chwinga Astronaut](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-astronaut-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 17*  

Chwingas that live in Wildspace usually dwell on habitable moons and asteroids, though they occasionally stow away on spelljamming ships or ride around on space guppies. Using its Magical Gift ability, a chwinga astronaut can bestow one of the following charms in place of those described in the "chapter 7".

- [Charm of Air Bubbles](3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/charm-of-air-bubbles-bam.md)  
- [Charm of Instant Tools](3-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/charm-of-instant-tools-bam.md)
