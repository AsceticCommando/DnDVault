# [Tempest Hart](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\elemental/tempest-hart-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Storm giants live high above Eldraine in a cloudy landscape known as Stormkeld. Massive cottages, keeps, and towers dot this magical realm, scattered between expanses of cloudy wilderness marked by tangles of giant beanstalks and raging storms. Various enormous creatures dwell in these wilds, with the tempest hart being among the most majestic.

A colossal elk with antlers made of living lightning, a tempest hart has a long mane of fine hair that waves as if tossed by a strong wind. Its patterned hide resembles the twisting beanstalks that also coil around its legs, shoulders, and haunches.

Storm giant hunters consider tempest harts to be the worthiest prey, desirable for their meat and the raw lightning of their antlers. However, these creatures wield mighty elemental power to defend themselves.
