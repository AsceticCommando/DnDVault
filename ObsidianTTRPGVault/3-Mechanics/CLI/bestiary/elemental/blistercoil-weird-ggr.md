# [Blistercoil Weird](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/blistercoil-weird-ggr.md)
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 207*  

A blistercoil weird is an anthropomorphic brute formed from water and molten rock. It absorbs energy from magical fire, causing its ooze-like body to increase in size. During one disastrous experiment, Izzet researchers observed a blistercoil weird expanding to fill a six-story workshop before it released all its excess energy in an enormous explosion and returned to its original size.

## Izzet Weirds

Weirds are the products of Izzet League experiments intended to combine two opposing elemental types in the hope of creating elementals that were more stable than the norm and easier to control. As commonly happens with Izzet experiments, the outcome was the exact opposite. Weirds are even wilder and more unpredictable than elementals of either of their component elements. Nevertheless, they can make potent guardian creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of their creators.

### Elemental Nature

An Izzet weird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
