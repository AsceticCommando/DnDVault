# [Lizardfolk Warden](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/lizardfolk-warden-hotb.md)
*Source: Heroes of the Borderlands p. 10*  

Lizardfolk wardens draw on primal magic to protect nature's boundaries. These territorial guardians lurk in wetlands and jungles, surfacing from murky pools to track down trespassers and drive them out. Wardens wield weapons and shields fashioned from the husks of giant beetles, snapping turtles, and other mighty creatures. When these tools fail them, they channel the forces of nature to augment their natural attacks with poison saliva.
