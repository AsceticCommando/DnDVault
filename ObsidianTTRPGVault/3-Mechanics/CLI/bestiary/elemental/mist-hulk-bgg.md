> I mourn for the hulks, all of them. The sight of a mist hulk, in particular, fills me with a melancholy that is hard to shake off.

Descended from ancient cloud giants, mist hulks are Elementals that embody their ancestors' mixed elemental nature of Air and Water. After countless ages of isolation—often on one of the Elemental Planes or some hidden demiplane—they retain the barest hint of their ancestors' physical form, and even less of the giants' culture.

A mist hulk resembles a bipedal figure made of dark rain clouds. Parts of its body seem more solid than others, but these parts are transparent enough that the churning vapors of the hulk's substance are visible inside. Wisps of cloud constantly leak from the creature, as if it might dissolve completely at any time. When it is slain, its misty form condenses into a torrent of water.

A mist hulk's mood is always gloomy, and when threatened, it often howls in infectious misery. All who hear this wail are magically reminded of past regrets, real or imagined.
