# [Cradle of the Storm Scion](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cradle-of-the-storm-scion-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 170*  

A scion of Stronmaus often slumbers high in the sky or deep in the ocean, where the tumult caused by the scion's restless sleep has little effect on the world. If it drifts too near the ground or the ocean surface, it causes mighty storms or fierce maelstroms. A scion's slumber is filled with dreams ranging from inspiring visions of Annam's return to melancholy prophecies of inevitable decline, from joyful glimpses of an idyllic past to horrific nightmares of torment and devastation.

A cradle of the storm scion stirs into action not only when the scion is threatened but also if the scion's sleep is troubled by nightmares. When roused, the cradle takes on a vaguely giant-shaped form consisting of air, water, and ice whirling in fury.

If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Stronmaus inside it awakens. Among the mightiest creatures of all giantkind, the scion stands 80 feet tall. It often finds some relief in waking and being freed from its troubling dreams, so it doesn't necessarily lash out in violence when emerging from its cradle. But it's not particularly interested in Humanoids or other little creatures—either in conversing with them or in protecting them from harm it might cause.

If the scion is threatened, it unleashes elemental might like few other forces in the multiverse can muster: blades of lightning, boulder-sized hailstones, and a storm of churning elements.

## Scions of Giants' Gods

Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children. But scions of giants' gods boast a greater claim: they are Annam's grandchildren, and they occupy a privileged place among giants. On some worlds, these scions ruled the first empires of giants until Annam retreated into seclusion. On other worlds, the scions guard their birthplaces (which are rich in elemental magic) or hold the substance of the world together. (See ""Giants of Myth"" in chapter 3 for additional inspiration.)

Scions of giants' gods are enormously powerful beings who infuse the world around them with primeval magic. In many worlds, they slumber and have become part of the landscape. In this case, each scion is enclosed in stasis inside a powerful Elemental called a cradle. The cradle protects the slumbering scion and follows its subconscious wishes, including driving off intruders. But if the cradle dies, the scion within fully awakens.
