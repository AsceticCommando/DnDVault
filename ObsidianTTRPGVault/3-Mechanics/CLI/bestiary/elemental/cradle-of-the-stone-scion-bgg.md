# [Cradle of the Stone Scion](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/cradle-of-the-stone-scion-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 168*  

A scion of Skoraeus typically slumbers deep in the heart of a towering mountain, almost becoming one with the earth. While the scion dreams, the mountain's minerals are transformed into fine carving stones and brilliant gems.

If a miner tunnels too close to the heart of the mountain, the cradle awakens as a bipedal mass of stone and crystals. It brings the weight of the mountain down on the intruder's head and unleashes an earsplitting roar that can collapse mine tunnels.

If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Skoraeus inside it awakens. At nearly 70 feet tall, it towers over most other creatures and wields a mass of crystal as a club. Once awakened, the scion continues to pursue the art that ornamented its dreams, seeking to mold and shape stone into beautiful elegance. If it needs more raw materials, the scion can transform a living creature in its palm into stone.

## Scions of Giants' Gods

Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children. But scions of giants' gods boast a greater claim: they are Annam's grandchildren, and they occupy a privileged place among giants. On some worlds, these scions ruled the first empires of giants until Annam retreated into seclusion. On other worlds, the scions guard their birthplaces (which are rich in elemental magic) or hold the substance of the world together. (See ""Giants of Myth"" in chapter 3 for additional inspiration.)

Scions of giants' gods are enormously powerful beings who infuse the world around them with primeval magic. In many worlds, they slumber and have become part of the landscape. In this case, each scion is enclosed in stasis inside a powerful Elemental called a cradle. The cradle protects the slumbering scion and follows its subconscious wishes, including driving off intruders. But if the cradle dies, the scion within fully awakens.
