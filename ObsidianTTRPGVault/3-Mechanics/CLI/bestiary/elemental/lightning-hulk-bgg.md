Lightning hulks are the descendants of storm giants who retreated from the world in ages past. Over the course of centuries, the elemental nature of these giants—aided by infusions of energy from the Elemental Planes—grew to dominate these giants, eventually freeing them from the limitations of flesh.

A lightning hulk is essentially a living bolt of lightning, with the one lasting vestige of its former nature being a vague face that appears at the head of the bolt as it streams through the air. In rare moments, the hulk coalesces into a bipedal shape resembling a storm giant, but these moments are as fleeting as a lightning strike. At other times, particularly when near metal or solid earth, the hulk seems on the verge of dispersing entirely, losing its last shreds of cohesion as a single entity. Its mental state is similarly incoherent: a lightning hulk rushes from one place to another with little sense of purpose and no hint of the contemplation that occupies its distant cousin giants.
