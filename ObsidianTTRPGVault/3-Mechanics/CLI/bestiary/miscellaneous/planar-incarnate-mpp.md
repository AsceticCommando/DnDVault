*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 41*  

The Upper and Lower Planes are fundamental manifestations of good and evil, law and chaos. In the most dire and fateful circumstances, these planes can manifest primal embodiments of their might. These expressions of a plane's power are called planar incarnates, and they appear as roiling energies with features distinct to the plane that created it. They protect their home from destructive or otherwise antithetical forces, then merge back into their plane of origin.

Planar incarnates are akin to natural disasters that work to protect and further the virtues and vices of the planes they originate upon. Those from the Lower Planes might appear as roiling waves of fiendish flames or other sinister forms, while those from the Upper Planes often appear as blooms of light and wild growth or similarly majestic shapes. On the rare occasions that planar incarnates appear on another plane, they might take either form or appear as unique manifestations of the philosophies they embody.
