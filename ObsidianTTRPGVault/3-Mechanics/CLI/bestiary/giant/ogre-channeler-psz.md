# [Ogre Channeler](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre-channeler-psz.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 31*  

The ogres of Zendikar are towering brutes driven by cruelty, greed, and savage ferocity. They favor the jagged mountains of Akoum but can be found on every continent. Their size and strength help protect them from the dangers of Zendikar, so they have little need of walls or roofs—which is good, since they have little skill at building. Ogre society, such as it is, revolves around leaders who gather small gangs (usually six to ten other ogres) to join them in pillaging, extorting, or slaving. The Monster Manual's [ogre](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre-xmm.md) statistics work fine for Zendikar ogres.

Despite their low intelligence, some more clever ogres—perhaps represented as [oni](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/oni-xmm.md)—master the use of certain kinds of magic. The use of red mana complements an ogre's fierce and angry tendencies, and some ogres can produce fiery spells and manipulate the volcanic forces of Akoum. Other ogres channel black mana to immerse themselves in necromancy and diabolism, accentuating their amoral nature and their willingness to enslave others for their own benefit.
