# [Troll Mutate](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/troll-mutate-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 187*  

When exposed to corrupting alien energy, such as that found near a gate to the Far Realm or the strange magic that emanates through the Underdark, a regenerating troll undergoes strange mutations. Among the most common mutations are wings, stretchable bodies, resistance to magic, and a strange reflective psychic property. Many troll mutates also have small additional limbs and eyes, externalized organs, and other variations.

## Trolls

The dwarven tale titled *The Saga of Gnarldan Steelshield* claims the god Vaprak the Destroyer came into being when Annam was injured and his blood spilled on the ground. The saga further claims that trolls were born similarly when Vaprak's blood was spilled. Whatever the truth of their origin, trolls embody life's steadfast determination to grow and thrive despite all obstacles.

Trolls' rapid healing makes them subject to bizarre mutations, particularly when they regenerate in unusual environments or heal from extraordinary magical wounds. Troll amalgams and troll mutates are two examples of such strangely mutated forms.
