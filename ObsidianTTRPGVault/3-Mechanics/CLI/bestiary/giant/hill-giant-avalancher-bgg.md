# [Hill Giant Avalancher](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant-avalancher-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 157*  

Hill giants who master rune magic discover a close connection to the natural forces of earth and stone. Their magic, combined with their size and strength, helps them quickly rise to positions of leadership.

These hill giants drape themselves in rocks attached to chains or ropes, then use their magic to knock down and pummel their foes with these stones. This magic, combined with their ability to defeat and devour their prey as quickly as a torrent of boulders cascades down a mountain, leads other giants to call them avalanchers.
