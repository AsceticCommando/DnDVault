Verbeeg are giants that resemble oversized humans with gangly limbs and elongated faces. Some have other features that give them a fearsome aspect.

Verbeeg craft their own armor and weapons. They prefer thrown spears above all other weapons, and a verbeeg usually has several spears for that purpose.

## Longstriders

Some verbeeg worship gods of nature and help defend the natural world. These even-tempered verbeeg are called longstriders and are blessed with innate spellcasting abilities.
