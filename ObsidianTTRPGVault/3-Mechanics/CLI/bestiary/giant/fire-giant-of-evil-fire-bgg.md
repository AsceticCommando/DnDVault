# [Fire Giant of Evil Fire](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant-of-evil-fire-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 139*  

A fire giant is born around flame, works with flame, and lives among flames, but a fire giant who gazes into flames too deeply may see the Prince of Evil Fire, Imix, gazing back. Giants who fall to Imix's corruption might leave their homes to join with like-minded cultists, but others remain within their communities to pursue Imix's destructive agenda.

A fire giant of Evil Fire forges a set of armor and weapons in flames blessed by Imix. The giant can then call on these magical flames to strike the foes of the Eternal Flame. The armor forged in these flames welds to the flesh, so while the giant isn't burned, the armor can't be removed once donned. When the giant dies, the armor explodes as a final gift from the All-Consuming Fire.
