# [Frost Giant Ice Shaper](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant-ice-shaper-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 145*  

Frost giants who master rune magic are known as ice shapers, and their sheer power typically contributes to a meteoric rise in the giants' ordning. Many of them end up as jarls, leading their communities, or as advisers to jarls—often the true power behind the throne. They are usually devoted to Thrym.

True to their name, these ice shapers manipulate the raw elemental energy of air and water to wield ice in both offense and defense. They summon ice elementals in the shape of wolves, cloak themselves in icy armor, and just as quickly turn that armor into a hail of deadly ice shards.

      The object bearing the rune has AC 16; 40 hit points; and immunity to necrotic,\
      \ poison, and psychic damage. The object regains all its hit points at the end\
      \ of every turn, but it turns to dust if reduced to 0 hit points or when the\

      \ stat block in the Monster Manual to represent them, but they are Elementals\
      \ instead of Monstrosities). The wolves appear in unoccupied spaces the giant\
      \ can see within 30 feet of itself. The wolves take their turn immediately after\
      \ the giant on the same initiative count, and they obey the giant's commands.\
      \ The wolves gain a +6 bonus to their attack and damage rolls while they are\
      \ within 30 feet of the giant. The wolves disappear after 1 minute, when the\
      \ giant dies, or when the giant uses this action again."

      \ saving throw or take 13 (3d8) cold damage."
