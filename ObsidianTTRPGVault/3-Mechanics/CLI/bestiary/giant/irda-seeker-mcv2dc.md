# [Irda Seeker](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\giant/irda-seeker-mcv2dc.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 2: Dragonlance Creatures p. 8*  

Irda seekers are skilled spies who use their magic to disguise themselves and gather intelligence for their allies. In combat, irda seekers can momentarily cloak themselves as they dart around the battlefield.

## Irda

The Dragon Queen created the irda long ago. While most irda embraced their wicked creator's teachings, some of them adopted the philosophies of other deities. Those irda who don't serve the Dragon Queen live in hidden communities across Krynn, avoiding the eyes of their creator and her minions.

Distantly related to oni, ogres, and other giant folk, irda have shimmering skin that ranges through shades of indigo and sea green. Their innate magic provides them with limited shape-shifting abilities and the power to create illusions.
