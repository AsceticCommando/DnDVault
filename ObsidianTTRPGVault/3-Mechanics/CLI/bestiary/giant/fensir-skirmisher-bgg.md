Fensir skirmishers boast great skill in battle, honed over centuries of endless conflict on the battlefields of Ysgard. They also wield elemental magic of earth and stone. True to their giant heritage, they can transform even a pinch of mud or gravel into a boulder suitable for hurling, and the thrown stone grows in flight to knock its target flat on impact.

## Fensirs

Long ago, a band of frost giants led trolls in a campaign to win Annam's favor by conquering the outer plane of Ysgard. The campaign's aspirations of conquest quickly failed, but the raiders discovered a key feature of Ysgard: creatures slain on that plane return to life the next dawn. Thus, the giants' incursion became a part of the eternal battle that rages across the plane. The trolls, whose fundamental nature was altered by constant regeneration and rebirth amid the energy of Ysgard, slowly changed into entirely new creatures: fensirs.

Fensirs' troll ancestry is hardly apparent in their appearance. They retain prominent noses and a hint of green in their skin but otherwise resemble relatively small frost or stone giants. They use armor and weapons similar to what other combatants on Ysgard use in the eternal battle.

The transformation that created fensirs left them with an odd quirk to their regenerative powers: their regeneration doesn't function in sunlight, and in fact, sunlight can turn these creatures to stone.

At the very least, the diversity of life in the multiverse increased, and new wonders were revealed. That's only bad if you think a small universe that fits within your narrow understanding is good.
