# [Fire Giant Forgecaller](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant-forgecaller-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 138*  

A fire giant who masters traditional rune magic can control the heat of a volcanic environment and conjure raw elemental energy of fire and magma. In a fire giant community, these forgecallers oversee both forges and the community's defense, often in Surtur's name. Some forgecallers prefer to live and work in isolation, seeking the hottest fires in volcanoes' hearts or the Elemental Plane of Fire to pursue their own crafts and studies.

A forgecaller is a walking furnace, clad head to toe in plate armor that seems to barely contain intense heat and billowing smoke. They conjure waves of magma and can fly by jetting magical fire from their legs and body.

      \ Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a\
      \ failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) fire damage and has the [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ condition. As an action, a creature can make a DC 19 Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\

      \ smoke, the giant has half cover. The armor stops billowing smoke after 1 minute,\
      \ when the giant dies, when the giant uses a bonus action to end the effect,\
      \ or when the giant's fire rune is destroyed."
