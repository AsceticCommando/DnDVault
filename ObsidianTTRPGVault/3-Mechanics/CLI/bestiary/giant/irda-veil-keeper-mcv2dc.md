# [Irda Veil Keeper](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\giant/irda-veil-keeper-mcv2dc.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 2: Dragonlance Creatures p. 9*  

Masters of their innate illusory powers, irda veil keepers protect their companions by weaving magical mirages that disorient foes. Rumors say that the most skilled irda veil keepers can keep entire enclaves hidden, guarding a community's inhabitants from the outside world for centuries.

## Irda

The Dragon Queen created the irda long ago. While most irda embraced their wicked creator's teachings, some of them adopted the philosophies of other deities. Those irda who don't serve the Dragon Queen live in hidden communities across Krynn, avoiding the eyes of their creator and her minions.

Distantly related to oni, ogres, and other giant folk, irda have shimmering skin that ranges through shades of indigo and sea green. Their innate magic provides them with limited shape-shifting abilities and the power to create illusions.
