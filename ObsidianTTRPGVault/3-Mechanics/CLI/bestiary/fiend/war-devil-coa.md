# [War Devil](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/war-devil-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 260*  

Created through the sacrifice of other devils, both alive and dead, war devils vary in size and shape, but not personality. They crave combat and are highly aggressive, often commanding legions of lesser devils in wars. While they greatly enjoy bullying weaker creatures and exerting their dominance, they're highly submissive towards more powerful creatures and higher ranked devils.

## Battle Commanders

War devils are also extremely loyal to their creators, following practically any order given to them. When not taking orders, war devils are clever enough to command and make decisions on their own, making them extremely talented generals.

## Mighty Devils

Because of their construction, the appearance of war devils varies. That said, there are a few features that are common among most of their kind. Almost all war devils have thick, leathery wings, as well as massive, curved horns and sharpened teeth. They're also usually massive in size, having been created from multiple other devils, with the larger ones usually having higher-ranked positions. Though they prefer to use polearms of all kinds, war devils are also fully capable unarmed.
