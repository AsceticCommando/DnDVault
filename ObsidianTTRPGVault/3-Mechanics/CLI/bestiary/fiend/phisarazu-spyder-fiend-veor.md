*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 235*  

Phisarazu spyder-fiends have a pair of muscular arms sprouting beneath their wolf heads. They are resentful and suspicious of all other creatures, which makes them useful for corralling kakkuus or standing guard.

Phisarazus can magically change their form, but only into shapes that have ten limbs, such as driders and crabs. They use this ability to establish ambushes, infiltrate enemy camps, or appear innocuous while on guard duty.

## Spyder-Fiends

Demonic beasts that combine the worst attributes of wolves and spiders, spyder-fiends scuttle about with bloated, spiderlike bodies and gnash with wolflike heads. Spyder-fiends are usually coated with gore, as brutal killing is their favorite pursuit. They spin durable webs and are ingenious in how they employ their webs against prey.

Spyder-fiends are organized into a hierarchy based on might and cunning, with higher-ranked spyder-fiends dominating lower ranks. Spyder-fiends of equivalent rank scheme against each other for advancement and eagerly turn against one another if treachery can improve their position.

Spyder-fiends loyally serve their general, Miska the Wolf-Spider. While they were rarely seen during Miska's imprisonment in Pandemonium, they have become increasingly active as Miska struggles to free himself in Pandesmos.
