*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 249*  

Another type of devil devoted to torture, excruciarchs are also competent fighters and mercenaries. Due to their reputation as torturers of devils, they're often looked down upon by other devils, occasionally even beaten or killed, and as a result they frequently travel together. Their cruelty is known across the Nine Hells, and their revelry in pain gives them their name. Another defining feature of pain devils is their greed: they serve no particular master, their loyalty must be purchased.

## Masked Devils

Excruciarchs appear almost humanoid in size and shape. Their skin is usually pale shades of white or red, and hair doesn't grow anywhere on their body. To conceal their identity and lend themselves some form of protection, almost all pain devils wear masks made from various types of leather, often adorned with spikes, horns, or ridges.

## Devoted to Pain

When an excruciarch enters battle, they activate a unique ability to inflict pain upon their adversaries. Excruciarchs thrive on even their own pain and they almost always fight to the death.
