Some legends claim the first ettins were orcs transformed by Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons, while others tie their origin to Grolantor or another god of the Ordning. Whatever the truth of their origin, ettins sometimes recognize a kindred soul in the two-headed Demogorgon and devote themselves to his service. Those who prove exceptionally valuable to Demogorgon's purposes in the Material Plane are rewarded with a "blessing" that transforms them into monstrous echoes of their demon patron.

The arms of an echo of Demogorgon transform into powerful tentacles, and the heads take on a more bestial appearance. The transformation leaves the echo frenzied with rage; the two heads shout and howl at each other with a fury that resounds with demonic magic, sowing discord and confusion around them. As the echo's monstrous heads roar and bite at each other, nearby creatures are racked with psychic pain or join in the ruckus, attacking their allies.
