# [Vargouille Reflection](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/vargouille-reflection-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 52*  

Vargouilles are flying Fiends that resemble disembodied Humanoid heads with wings. While most vargouilles roam the planes to curse Humanoids and create more vargouilles, a variant known as the vargouille reflection resides in Undersigil. When a vargouille reflection spots a Humanoid target, it takes on that creature's visage, terrifying that creature by appearing as its own disembodied head.
