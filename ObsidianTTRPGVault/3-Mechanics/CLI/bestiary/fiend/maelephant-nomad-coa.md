# [Maelephant Nomad](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-nomad-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 245*  

Created with the sole purpose of protection, maelephants are the most loyal of the devils. They eschew personal possessions, dreams, and goals, and find happiness in the completion of their duty. While other devils may view them as simple and unintelligent, many recognize the importance and utility of maelephants. Infernal and common are often spoken languages, but maelephants also maintain their own unique language, which they use exclusively in communication with others of their kind.

## Elephantine Warriors

As their name would suggest, maelephants share many physical features with elephants. They stand on two legs, but have an elephant-like head and legs. Their trunk usually ends in a sharp spike, and their hands and feet are both clawed. When threatened, maelephants emit a cloud of toxins that cause brain damage and memory loss.

## Driven by Duty

Despite them being lower-ranked devils, their position as trustworthy guardians makes other lower devils respect maelephants. When not under active duty or protecting something, a maelephant might aimlessly wander the layers searching for a new charge. Some of these nomads wander many years before finally ending their search.
