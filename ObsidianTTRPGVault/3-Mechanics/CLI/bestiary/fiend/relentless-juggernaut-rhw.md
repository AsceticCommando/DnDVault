# [Relentless Juggernaut](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/relentless-juggernaut-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 263*  

Relentless juggernauts are massive brutes that ceaselessly stalk their targets. These juggernauts wield specially crafted blades and blunt stones as implements of obliteration.

## Relentless Killers

*Pact-Bound Murderers*

Relentless killers are fiend-twisted maniacs that arise from mortals who make pacts with nefarious forces. Such killers' powers vary depending on their obsessions and the source of their powers.
