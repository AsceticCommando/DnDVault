# [Hellcat (Bezekira)](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/hellcat-bezekira-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 244*  

Possessing a unique ability to detect both the alignment and strength of an individual telepathically, bezekiras, otherwise known as hellcats, search for the most powerful master of lawful evil alignment. Once they've found a master, they're extremely loyal and follow all commands, until a stronger master comes along. When not serving a master, hellcats are fiercely independent, secretive, and intelligent.

## Hard to See

When visible, hellcats take on the appearance of larger cats, including lions and tigers. However, they have an innate invisibility when in any source of light, preventing their corporeal form from appearing anywhere outside of total darkness. They appear wraith-like, with the wispy outline of their body composed of ethereal light and devilish fire. Though they rarely hunt creatures of evil alignment, good creatures are slaughtered on sight, sometimes even against their master's orders. Bezekiras propagate through natural means, though petitioners and devils are sometimes given their form.
