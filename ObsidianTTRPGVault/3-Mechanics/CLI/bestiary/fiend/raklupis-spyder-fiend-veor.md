*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 236*  

Raklupis spyder-fiends have hard, smooth shells and gleaming spines. With luxuriantly furry wolf heads, powerful arms, and alluring voices, raklupises are the only spyder-fiends that might be called majestic. They create delicate web globes, which they fill with their venom and hurl at foes. Raklupises are keen strategists, and most of them command legions of lesser spyder-fiends.

## Spyder-Fiends

Demonic beasts that combine the worst attributes of wolves and spiders, spyder-fiends scuttle about with bloated, spiderlike bodies and gnash with wolflike heads. Spyder-fiends are usually coated with gore, as brutal killing is their favorite pursuit. They spin durable webs and are ingenious in how they employ their webs against prey.

Spyder-fiends are organized into a hierarchy based on might and cunning, with higher-ranked spyder-fiends dominating lower ranks. Spyder-fiends of equivalent rank scheme against each other for advancement and eagerly turn against one another if treachery can improve their position.

Spyder-fiends loyally serve their general, Miska the Wolf-Spider. While they were rarely seen during Miska's imprisonment in Pandemonium, they have become increasingly active as Miska struggles to free himself in Pandesmos.
