# [Relentless Nightmare](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/relentless-nightmare-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 263*  

A relentless nightmare uses foul magic to put its victims into a fitful slumber before attacking them. If destroyed, a relentless nightmare can re-form from the dreams of any creature marked with its curse.

## Relentless Killers

*Pact-Bound Murderers*

Relentless killers are fiend-twisted maniacs that arise from mortals who make pacts with nefarious forces. Such killers' powers vary depending on their obsessions and the source of their powers.
