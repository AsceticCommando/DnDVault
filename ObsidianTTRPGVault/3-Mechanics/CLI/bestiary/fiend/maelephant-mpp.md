Respected as guardians by villains across the multiverse, maelephants are Fiends with pachyderm-like heads. They can exhale toxic fumes that cause foes to temporarily forget their combat training, spellcasting abilities, and other skills.

Maelephants strike bargains with wicked spellcasters and entities of the Lower Planes, pledging to guard a site or object for decades. The Fiends fulfill their end of the bargain with unwavering loyalty, steadfastly tending to their posts per the terms of their agreement.
