# [Pestilence Demon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/pestilence-demon-psz.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 27*  

The dark reflections of angels, demons are the incarnation of black mana and all it represents—selfish desire and lust for power. Their forms are roughly humanoid, but distorted and bestial. Their grotesque heads feature elongated ears, spiky protrusions, and large horns. (The size and number of a demon's horns are an indication of its age and power.) Spikes protrude from their backs and arms, and their hands are warped into large, sharp claws. Most demons have large, leathery wings, and a few have long tails. Their skin has an inhuman texture—dry and leathery for some; stony and cold for others. Their eyes are small points of red or blue light that glow as if revealing an inner inferno.

Unlike angels, demons reject any form of society or alliance. They are utterly selfish and hoard power in many different forms, including wealth, magic, territory, and slaves. Drawn to places where black mana flows freely, they often dwell in ancient crypts or in ruins deep in swampy terrain. Their presence defiles any remaining scrap of purity or goodness in an area, and often extends the bounds of a swamp or stirs up the restless spirits of the dead.

Any demon, devil, or yugoloth in the Monster Manual can stand in for a demon of Zendikar. The vile green mist surrounding a pestilence demon suggests it might have poison like a [vrock](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/vrock-xmm.md), for example.
