# [Kelubar Demodand](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/kelubar-demodand-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 27*  

Kelubars, sometimes called slimy demodands, are the bureaucrats of Carceri, existing as intermediaries between farastus and shators. They are squat, and their skin drips with a foul-smelling, acidic slime. Kelubars revel in the subservience of others, and they prefer to do battle with words—or at least to send in their farastu minions—rather than fight directly.

## Demodands

Demodands, also called gehreleths, are Fiends from the Tarterian Depths of Carceri. Cast into the prison plane long ago for forgotten transgressions, these bitter, wicked creatures have appointed themselves the jailers of the plane. Demodands viciously defend the few known portals that lead out of Carceri and ruthlessly torment other creatures trapped there.

Demodands that manage to leave Carceri know they're doomed to return; a demodand that dies outside Carceri re-forms there in a torturous process that takes `dice:2d20|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d20`) days. Even those who survive on other planes find themselves eventually dragged back, pulled by some planar tether.
