# [Giant Goose](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/giant-goose-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 150*  

Giants keep geese as livestock for eggs and because geese make excellent sentries, protecting the giants' property with their keen senses and loud voices. Not only are giant geese from fey stock significantly larger than ordinary geese, but they also have two magical properties that make them even more valuable: their honk is a powerful defense against intruders, and they can lay eggs with shells of pure gold.

When commanded by its keeper, a giant goose lays a golden egg—a hollow shell of gold, 1 foot long and weighing 2 pounds. The shell is worth 100 gp. Sometimes, the egg inexplicably contains some kind of small trinket or minor magic item. Once it lays a golden egg, a giant goose can't do so again for a year and a day.

You can use the [Goose Egg Trinket](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/goose-egg-trinket-bgg.md) table to determine the contents of a golden egg. A giant goose's egg can be a great way to give characters an item that's important to the story of an adventure or your campaign.
