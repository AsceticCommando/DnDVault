# [Dankwood Hag](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/dankwood-hag-awm.md)
*Source: Adventure with Muk p. 31*  

Dankwood hags are the worst kind of hags in the world. They are creepy and grumpy with long fingers that end in iron claws. They are known to eat small goblins and other warm-blooded creatures, but Dankwood hags are especially fond of sparkleberry tarts.

Since sparkleberries grow only where dryads have their sacred groves, Dankwood hags don't dare enter lest they anger the dryads and suffer their wrath. Dankwood hags are also very greedy and this can be used against them to lure them into a trap or trick them into eating something they shouldn't.
