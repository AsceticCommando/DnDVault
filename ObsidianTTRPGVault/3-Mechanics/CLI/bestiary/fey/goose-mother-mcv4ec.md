# [Goose Mother](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/goose-mother-mcv4ec.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Astonishingly aggressive geese populate the marshes of Eldraine. Legends tell that these geese descend from a monstrous many-headed bird that dwells deep within the wilds. Though the knights of Eldraine consider its existence a myth, the folk of the wilds know that the Goose Mother is real.

Centuries ago, an enterprising witch created a frothy stew composed of hydra's blood and goose feathers. It is from this noxious slurry that the Goose Mother was born. Within days, the Goose Mother grew to prodigious size, and the witch grew fearful. One night, while the Goose Mother slept, the witch took to its neck with a cleaver, but to her horror, two more heads sprouted in place of the first. Enraged, the Goose Mother devoured the witch and rampaged deep into the wilds where it lives to this day.

The Goose Mother lays one golden egg every hour, precisely on the hour. Sometimes these eggs hatch into clutches of young geese that grow up to terrorize the marshes of Eldraine. Other times, the eggs contain trinkets or valuables. The fae folk of Eldraine's wilds have developed a symbiotic relationship with the Goose Mother, often bringing it fresh meat in exchange for the treasures inside its golden eggs.

If you have "Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants", you can use the [Goose Egg Trinket](3-Mechanics/CLI/items/goose-egg-trinket-bgg.md) table to determine the contents of one of the Goose Mother's eggs that isn't destined to hatch into a goose or a giant goose (also described in that book).
