# [Sea Fury](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sea-fury-egw.md)
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 299*  

In times of great danger, sea hags form massive covens to channel powerful magic against outside threats. But when the threat is vanquished, these covens often destroy themselves from within. One sea hag grows more powerful than the others, killing its kin one by one and siphoning their magical power as it does so.

Driven to madness by the power it claims—and by the loneliness that is the cost of its killing spree—the hag becomes a sea fury, which hoards treasure, spreads rumors, and does everything within its power to lure sailors and explorers to its lair. By doing so, it hopes to break its loneliness for a time—and then to destroy its new playthings when they have outlived their usefulness.
