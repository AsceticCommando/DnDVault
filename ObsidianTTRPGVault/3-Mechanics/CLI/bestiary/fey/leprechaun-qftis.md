*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 205*  

Leprechauns are manifestations of the Feywild rules of hospitality and reciprocity. These rules infuse leprechauns with a deep connection to fixing and making things. Industrious and proud, leprechauns channel this creative energy into their tools, using them to quickly mend damaged objects, craft new ones from raw materials, and mold ideas into vivid illusions.

A leprechaun's adherence to Feywild rules affords it tremendous luck, but this fortune comes at a cost. These same magical strictures compel leprechauns to use their powers on behalf of those who offer them gifts. Leprechauns despise greed and are spiteful toward anyone who makes demands without first offering a gift or, worse, anyone who tries to steal from them. They delight in pranking such foolish creatures or pilfering from them in return.

Leprechauns take pride in their appearances, dressing in dapper outfits that typically feature red fabrics, gleaming belts and buckles, and natural woodland accouterments. These fashions compliment their bright green skin, exuberant hair, and upbeat demeanors.
