## Swanmay

*Shape-Changing Protector of Nature*

Swanmays are members of a reclusive order of wilderness defenders. Each bears a primal blessing that allows them to transform into a swan to watch over the lakes and woods they call home. Swanmays get along well with dryads and other creatures devoted to protecting the wilderness.

Roll or choose a result from the Swanmay's Charge table as inspiration for what a swanmay protects.
