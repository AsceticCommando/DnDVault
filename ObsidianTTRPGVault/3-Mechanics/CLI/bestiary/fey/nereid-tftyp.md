One of the most inviting locations in the Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan is a gently illuminated pool of water, beside which sits a lovely being singing a pleasant tune. The figure is a nereid—a fey water creature that can shape its environment to suit its needs. Whether male or female, a nereid bears an otherworldly beauty.
