# [Dryad](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/dryad-psx.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Ixalan p. 38*  

It is said that the only force on Ixalan not interested in finding the golden city is Ixalan itself. Dryads, as incarnations of the land and its will, prove the saying true. Their only concern is the health of the forest: when the trees and ferns are healthy, the dryads flourish. But when the vampires' dusk fog or a demon's unwholesome influence cause the jungle to wither, the dryads suffer. As a result, they are generally friendly with the River Heralds, who live in harmony with nature, and hostile to the Legion of Dusk.

The dryads otherwise have no stake in the conflict between the people of Ixalan and the invaders, but as creatures of life and growth, they hate to see any living being suffer. Thus, they have been known to tend to wounded people left in the jungle to die, sharing their own abundant life energy with those in their care.

Ixalan's dryads are identical to the [dryads](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/dryad-xmm.md) in the "Monster Manual".
