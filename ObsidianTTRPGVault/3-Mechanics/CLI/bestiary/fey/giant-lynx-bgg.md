*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 151*  

Though they're often mistaken for mundane cats, giant lynxes are magical creatures with origins in the snowy woodlands of the Feywild. Their coats grow lighter in winter, helping to camouflage them in their favored habitats even when the landscape is draped in snow.

Giant lynxes are crafty hunters, cooperating in small groups to trap prey and occasionally using a magical gift to scout likely hunting locations. They're also smart enough to outwit many of the hunters who seek to trap them for their fur, and they're fond of disabling any trappers' snares they find in their territories.

Frost and cloud giants sometimes befriend giant lynxes and treat them as beloved pets. As long as the lynxes' intelligence and independence are respected, the creatures are happy to share their divination magic with their giant companions.

> Shortly before encountering the frost giant whose well-placed boulder ended my human existence, Mordenkainen and I saw a giant lynx. It was just staring into space, in that oh-so-feline way. Mordenkainen wanted to talk to it, to find out what it was looking at, but I successfully dissuaded him.
