# [Dream Eater](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/dream-eater-mcv2dc.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 2: Dragonlance Creatures p. 3*  

Originating from the dream-warped elven realm of Silvanesti, dream eaters are violent manifestations of nightmares and subconscious terrors. The true appearance of a dream eater is obscured, as the dream eater twists its hazy form into surreal illusions of its foes' greatest fears. However, all dream eaters share one thing: a gaping, always-smiling mouth, which it reveals before engulfing its prey in a phantasmagorical nightmare.

The key to defeating a dream eater lies not in brute force but in the ability to pierce its illusions and wrest others from its terrors. As such, bards and other persuasive adventurers find themselves uniquely poised to confront a hungering dream eater.

"bonus_actions":
  - "desc": "The dream eater targets one creature within 5 feet of itself. The target\
      \ must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be engulfed by the dream eater,\
      \ as the dream eater envelops the creature in a miasma of its worst fears.\n\
      \nWhen the dream eater engulfs a target, the dream eater enters its space, and\
      \ the target immediately takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. An engulfed target is\
      \ [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) and [blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded),\
      \ and it takes an additional 10 (3d6) psychic damage at the start of each of\
      \ the dream eater's turns. When the dream eater moves, the engulfed target moves\
      \ with it.\n\nThe dream eater can have only one target engulfed at a time. An\
      \ engulfed target escapes at the start of its turn by making a DC 16 Wisdom\
      \ saving throw. On a successful save, the target escapes; the target is no longer\
      \ engulfed, and it enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the dream eater.\
      \ A creature within 15 feet of the dream eater also can use its action to attempt\
      \ to free an engulfed target. Doing so requires the creature to use its action\
      \ to make a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion))\
      \ check to convince the engulfed target the nightmare isn't real, with the target\
      \ escaping on a success. The creature making the check takes 10 (3d6) psychic\
      \ damage, regardless of the check's success or failure, as its mind brushes\
      \ against the nightmare."
