# [Kuo-toa Marauder](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/kuo-toa-marauder-hotb.md)
*Source: Heroes of the Borderlands p. 8*  

Kuo-toa have slimy, humanoid bodies and the heads of goggle-eyed deep-sea fish. They claim they once dominated whole worlds, their empires spanning land and sea under the blessings of piscine gods.

Kuo-toa undertake contrived plots to propel themselves to dominance, often kidnapping people to learn their secrets or making dubious sacrifices to bizarre gods. These marauders lurk in wet places, eager to shed blood and claim plunder.
