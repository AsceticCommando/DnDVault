  - "desc": "The beholder shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random\
      \ (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet\
      \ of it:\n\n- **1. Charm Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14\
      \ Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder harms the creature.  \n\
      - **2. Paralyzing Ray.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution\
      \ saving throw or be [paralyzed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed)\
      \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of\
      \ its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **3. Fear Ray.**\
      \ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
      \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of\
      \ its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **4. Slowing Ray.**\
      \ The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a\
      \ failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature\
      \ can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on\
      \ its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of\
      \ each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- **5. Enervation\
      \ Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw,\
      \ taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on\
      \ a successful one.  \n- **6. Telekinetic Ray.** If the target is a creature,\
      \ it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it\
      \ up to 30 feet in any direction. It is [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
      \ by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the beholder's next turn\
      \ or until the beholder is [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).\
      \  \n\n    If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't\
      \ being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The beholder\
      \ can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating\
      \ a simple tool or opening a door or a container.  \n- **7. Sleep Ray.** The\
      \ targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep\
      \ and remain [unconscious](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious)\
      \ for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes\
      \ an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.  \n\
      - **8. Petrification Ray.** The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity\
      \ saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is\
      \ [restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). It must repeat\
      \ the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends.\
      \ On a failure, the creature is [petrified](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified)\
      \ until freed by the [greater restoration](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md)\
      \ spell or other magic.  \n- **9. Disintegration Ray.** If the target is a creature,\
      \ it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force\
      \ damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes\
      \ a pile of fine gray dust.  \n\n    If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical\
      \ object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving\
      \ throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force,\
      \ this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.  \n- **10. Death Ray.** The targeted\
      \ creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10)\
      \ necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.  "
