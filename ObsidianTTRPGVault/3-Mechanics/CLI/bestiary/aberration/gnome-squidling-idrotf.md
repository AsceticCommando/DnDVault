# [Gnome Squidling](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/gnome-squidling-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 303*  

Mind flayers, which are described in the Monster Manual, are created through ceremorphosis, a process that begins with the implantation of an illithid tadpole in the brain of a humanoid host. After about seven days in its new home, the tadpole transforms its host into a mind flayer. The new creation typically retains no memory of its previous existence.

When the process of turning a gnome into a mind flayer goes horribly awry, the result is a gnome squidling—a deformed mind flayer with weak, spindly limbs and oversized tentacles. It relies on levitation to keep its body aloft and uses its tentacles like legs, to propel it along whatever surface it's floating above. Most mind flayers destroy squidlings on sight, so it's rare to see one or more of these creatures.

Squidlings eat brains for sustenance, just like other mind flayers do, and they don't care where the brains come from.
