# [Githzerai Uniter](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/githzerai-uniter-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 31*  

Githzerai uniters espouse wisdom and unity rather than violence. Many uniters are members of the Sha'sal Khou, a group of githyanki and githzerai who band together to reunify the gith people. Capable martial artists, uniters are more inclined to disarm and subdue their opponents than destroy them.

## Githzerai

Githzerai descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of the githyanki—all of whom were destroyed or transformed by mind flayers. Many githzerai dwell in Limbo, honing their psionic powers by shaping their homes on that chaotic plane. The githzerai described here oftentimes traverse the planes, crossing between them via the portals in Sigil and the Outlands. To learn more about other githzerai, see the *Monster Manual*.
