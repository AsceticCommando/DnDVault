# [Derro Apprentice](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/derro-apprentice-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 196*  

Derro who have just begun to discover and control their magic are called apprentices. The magic of a derro apprentice is dangerous and unpredictable.

## Derro

Derro are Underdark dwellers of dubious origin. According to the histories of some duergar, derro are descended from a community of dwarves that was left behind when the others escaped the rule of mind flayers. The mind flayers' psionic power eventually transformed these forsaken dwarves into Aberrations.

You can learn more about derro in *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse*.
