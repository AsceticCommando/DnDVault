# [Neogi Void Hunter](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/neogi-void-hunter-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 41*  

A neogi void hunter is bigger than a typical adult neogi and often fills the role of captain aboard a nightspider (see the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*). The void hunter pledges fealty to one or more stellar entities in exchange for a taste of their immense power. These entities—known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar—resemble stars and embody the essence of evil.
