# [Memory Web](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/memory-web-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 208*  

A memory web is a living web that resembles an ordinary web spun by an ettercap, a giant spider, or another oversized arachnid. Memory webs lie in ambush draped over plant life, wrapped around corpses, or stuck to ossuaries in dark catacombs.

Memory webs feed on memories and require daily sustenance. When a memory web's prey draws close, the web springs at the creature and wraps it in sticky, cord-like fibers. The web then drains its victim's memories, sapping the creature's life force in the process. A memory web can continue to feed on a corpse's memories for days after its death.

If a memory web is slain, any memories it consumed over the last day are discharged from its body in a telepathic deluge. Some of these memories lodge themselves in the minds of nearby creatures as dreamlike recollections, potentially spurring their inheritors to action. The Memory Web Memories table presents adventure seeds that might be released by a slain memory web.
