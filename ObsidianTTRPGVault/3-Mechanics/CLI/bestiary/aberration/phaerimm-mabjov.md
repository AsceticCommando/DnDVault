# [Phaerimm](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/phaerimm-mabjov.md)
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy p. 145*  

Highly intelligent, phaerimms are malevolent aberrations that dwell deep beneath the surface of the world. Natural spellcasters, they delight in bringing pain and suffering to others. It is said phaerimms would willingly wipe every other being from existence, save for the fact they would then lack slaves to torture for sport.

## Monstrous Horrors

Phaerimms are hideous looking creatures—bulbous bodies with spindly arms and legs, topped by a gaping maw filled with row upon row of razor-sharp teeth. Their evil magic drains life and moisture from the natural world, and the Anauroch Desert was created through extensive use of their powers.

## Mental Enslavement

A phaerimm's mind-controlling abilities rival those of any mind flayer or beholder. Extremely solitary beings, they surround themselves with a retinue of mentally dominated creatures that serve as bodyguards, soldiers, and hunters. When these thralls cease to be useful, they are slaughtered and devoured by their phaerimm master. The phaerimm language is incomprehensible to humanoids, even with the use of magical assistance. However, a phaerimm can use telepathic magic to communicate with other beings through its slaves, though due to their solitary existence they seldom have need to communicate at all. The only real exception occurs on those rare occasions when several phaerimm will work together to defeat an enemy that is too strong for them to face individually.

## An Endangered Species

Phaerimms were pushed to the edge of extinction thousands of years ago by the ancient Netherese wizards. Only a few isolated pockets still exist, typically sealed away in deep chambers by their enemies. Phaerimms still have a particular hatred for tomb tappers, a Netherese construct that is immune to their mind control. Their population has been slow to recover from this purge, as a phaerimm is only capable of producing a single egg every century. This egg must be injected into a host through a stinger on the phaerimm's tail, which paralyzes the victim. The larva then consumes the host—still alive—from the inside.
