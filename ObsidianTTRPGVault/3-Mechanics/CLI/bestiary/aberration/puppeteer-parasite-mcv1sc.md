# [Puppeteer Parasite](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/puppeteer-parasite-mcv1sc.md)
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 1: Spelljammer Creatures p. 11*  

A puppeteer parasite looks like a rubbery amoeba the size of a dinner plate. Its dorsal surface is soft and glossy, while its ventral surface is lined with bony hooks. The parasite uses its hooks to attach to a wall or ceiling until suitable prey passes nearby.

A parasite that comes in physical contact with a Humanoid uses its hooks to latch onto it. The parasite can then drain life energy from that creature or use it as transportation. The parasite can also impose its will on a nearby creature, forcing the creature to comply with its wishes. Puppeteer parasites like to use Humanoid thralls as bodyguards and transports.
