# [Feyr](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/feyr-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 22*  

A feyr (pronounced "fear") is a tentacled horror that feeds quietly on strong emotions. To minimize the chance of harm to itself, it prefers to devour the nightmares of other creatures while they sleep.

Feyrs shun bright light but aren't harmed by it. Consequently, they are as much at home in the void of Wildspace as they are in dark alleys and dungeons. A feyr that comes across a spelljamming ship tries to enter the ship's air envelope and stow away, remaining secluded and invisible until it finds a sleeping victim it can attack. It retreats rather than allows itself to perish in a confrontation.
