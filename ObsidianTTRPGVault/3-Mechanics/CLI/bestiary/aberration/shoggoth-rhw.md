*Source: RHW p. 266*  

*Hulking, Amorphous Predator*

Shoggoths are massive, undulating horrors possessed of ancient and cruel intellects. Created by elder things, the first shoggoths created cyclopean cities and performed dangerous labor in forgotten ages. Eventually, the shoggoths grew stronger and overthrew their makers. Since then, shoggoths have lurked in the ruins of their ancient cities and in hidden places across the multiverse. They tend to brood in remote, icy reaches where their bodies are invigorated by the blistering cold.
