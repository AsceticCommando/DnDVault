# [Greater Star Spawn Emissary](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/greater-star-spawn-emissary-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 268*  

An emissary's greater form is a destructive abomination. This massive amalgamation of violent flesh is composed of the meat and voices of every form the emissary has ever mimicked. Only once this greater form is destroyed is the emissary defeated.

## Star Spawn Emissaries

*Colossal, Shape-Shifting Alien Colonizers*

Star spawn emissaries are the fingers of alien realms, digits that tip the scales of reality toward terror. Heralded by ominous astrological events, these ravenous invaders make worlds ready for their unimaginable masters. Employing two malleable forms, emissaries undermine perceptions of order, trust, and reality on global scales, readying worlds for sanity-shattering revelations and cascading apocalypses.

### Star Spawn Emissary Lairs

A star spawn emissary's lair takes on macabre bodily features. A ruined watchtower might become a spire of pulsating flesh, or an abandoned mineshaft might transform into a maze of sticky, muscular innards.
