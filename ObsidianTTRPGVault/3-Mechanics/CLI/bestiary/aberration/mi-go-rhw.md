*Brain-Robbing Alien Fungus*

Bizarre beings that profanely unite features of alien insects and otherworldly fungus, mi-go bend their unfathomable intellects toward colonizing worlds and controlling the inhabitants. They work with bizarre precision, learning all they can about how other creatures think and define identity. To this end, mi-go extract creatures' brains for research and experimentation. Occasionally they swap brains between individuals, or they place stolen brains into the bodies of radically different creatures, then observe the results from afar.

Mi-go aren't impeded by light, but they prefer the dark. They typically lurk in secluded caverns and amid remote heights.
