# [Phaerimm Hatchling](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/phaerimm-hatchling-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 268*  

Phaerimm zealously guard their rare hatchlings not out of parental devotion, but to ensure their kind's growing strength.

## Phaerimm

*Alien, Magic-Obsessed Manipulators*

Phaerimm are malevolent alien beings that seek to dominate other sentient species. A phaerimm's conical body ripples through the air, trailing behind a large, flat mouth ringed by four delicate arms. A phaerimm's body tapers to a venomous stinger they prefer to use only when magical means fail them.

Ancient phaerimm devastated the once-powerful empire of Netheril. The phaerimm were imprisoned beneath the great desert of Anauroch, where they plot a return to their former dominion. Roll or choose a result from the Phaerimm Plots table as inspiration for what a phaerimm agent might be doing when encountered.
