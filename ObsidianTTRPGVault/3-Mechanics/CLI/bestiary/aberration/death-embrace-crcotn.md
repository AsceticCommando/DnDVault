# [Death Embrace](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/death-embrace-crcotn.md)
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 197*  

Drifting through the dark waters of the Netherdeep, the death embrace is an ominous sight. Beneath its bell hangs a lacy, tendrilous mass that thrums with magic, surrounded by six 60-foot-long, barbed tentacles. The death embrace uses these tentacles to grasp and petrify its prey.

Despite its foreboding name, the death embrace is not an overly aggressive creature. It prefers to bide its time, using creatures it has caught in its tentacles as shields to absorb attacks.
