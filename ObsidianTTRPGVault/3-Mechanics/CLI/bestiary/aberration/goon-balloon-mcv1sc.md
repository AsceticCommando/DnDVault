> We found several of the creatures in an astral diamond mine at the edge of Greyspace. The miners wanted us to eliminate them. Our warlock, who was fluent in Deep Speech, managed to convince the bulbous creatures to relocate peacefully. They insisted we take them to a small, misshapen moon that doesn't appear on our charts. A horrible fear grips me. What if they're leading us into a trap?

A goon balloon looks like a 5-foot-diameter beach ball with clawed feet. Unblinking eyes on the outer surface of its spherical air sac enable the creature to see in all directions at once. These eyes can produce kaleidoscopic light that tears at the minds of the goon balloon's foes.

A goon balloon speaks by pumping air through a hidden orifice on its underside. When the goon balloon dies, the air in its sac transforms into a noxious gas that bursts from the corpse, potentially poisoning other creatures nearby.

Although they can seem playful and harmless, goon balloons are quite mean-spirited. They like to observe the suffering of other creatures and orchestrate that suffering, given half a chance.
