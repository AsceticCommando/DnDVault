# [Lesser Star Spawn Emissary](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/lesser-star-spawn-emissary-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 267*  

A star spawn emissary's lesser form allows it to appear as another creature. Emissaries readily appear as people, animals, or other creatures—the more unassuming, the better. Should an emissary's true form be revealed and defeated, its greater form appears and seeks revenge moments or days later.

## Star Spawn Emissaries

*Colossal, Shape-Shifting Alien Colonizers*

Star spawn emissaries are the fingers of alien realms, digits that tip the scales of reality toward terror. Heralded by ominous astrological events, these ravenous invaders make worlds ready for their unimaginable masters. Employing two malleable forms, emissaries undermine perceptions of order, trust, and reality on global scales, readying worlds for sanity-shattering revelations and cascading apocalypses.

### Star Spawn Emissary Lairs

A star spawn emissary's lair takes on macabre bodily features. A ruined watchtower might become a spire of pulsating flesh, or an abandoned mineshaft might transform into a maze of sticky, muscular innards.
