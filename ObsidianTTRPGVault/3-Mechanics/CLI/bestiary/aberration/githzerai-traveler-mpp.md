# [Githzerai Traveler](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/githzerai-traveler-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 31*  

Githzerai travelers wander the multiverse to train and pursue cosmic enlightenment. These githzerai learn to manipulate planar energies to create wondrous effects.

Githzerai descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of the githyanki—all of whom were destroyed or transformed by mind flayers. Many githzerai dwell in Limbo, honing their psionic powers by shaping their homes on that chaotic plane. The githzerai described here oftentimes traverse the planes, crossing between them via the portals in Sigil and the Outlands. To learn more about other githzerai, see the *Monster Manual*.
