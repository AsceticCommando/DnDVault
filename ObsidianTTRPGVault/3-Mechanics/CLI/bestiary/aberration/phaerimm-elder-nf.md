# [Phaerimm Elder](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/phaerimm-elder-nf.md)

Phaerimm elders are generals of phaerimm forces, directing covert and direct operations to help their kind subjugate all who stand in their way. Their ability to siphon magic from magic items makes them incredibly dangerous foes.
