# [Large Drake](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/large-drake-psa.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 33*  

Drakes are similar to dragons, though they lack any ability to breathe fire and have only two legs in addition to their huge wings. They are less aggressive than dragons, and possibly slightly more intelligent. They are drawn by the glint of lazotep in mines, the shine of gold in Naktamun, and the glimmer of the sun on the water of the Luxa river. They also like to perch on obelisks and other spires on city buildings.

A [pteranodon](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/pteranodon-xmm.md) can represent a smaller drake, while a larger one is more like a [giant eagle](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/giant-eagle-xmm.md).
