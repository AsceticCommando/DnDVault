# [Great Cat](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/great-cat-psz.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 34*  

At least two varieties of great cat (similar to the [saber-toothed tiger](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/saber-toothed-tiger-xmm.md)) sport enormous blades jutting back from the forelegs, which help them cut through heavy undergrowth and take down much larger prey.
