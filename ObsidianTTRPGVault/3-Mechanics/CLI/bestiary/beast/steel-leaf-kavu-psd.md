## Deadly Chargers

Though the Basiphem dwell in the highest layer of the forest, they maintain extensive stables on the forest floor to house and train the largest ground-dwelling kavu. Members of the Order of the Steel Leaf often ride these creatures into battle, with the largest of the kavu sometimes reaching the size of elephants.

## Kavu

Kavu are reptilian creatures that are either very ancient or a relatively recent creation on Dominaria. Either awakening from a millennia-long hibernation or springing fully formed into being, they emerged from the ground to defend against the Phyrexian Invasion. The Llanowar elves now breed the kavu to fill a variety of roles, believing that these creatures were the goddess Gaea's means of intervening in Dominaria's defense. The close relationship between elves and kavu is a constant reminder of Gaea's beneficence. Every Kelfae bonds with an arboreal kavu companion, and some Kelfae and Basiphem warriors ride them into battle.
