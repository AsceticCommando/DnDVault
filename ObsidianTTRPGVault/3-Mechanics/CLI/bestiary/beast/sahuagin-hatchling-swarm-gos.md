# [Sahuagin Hatchling Swarm](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/sahuagin-hatchling-swarm-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 250*  

Roiling through the waters in The Final Enemy, these swarms of sahuagin hatchlings are dangerous to any creatures they encounter. Other sahuagin avoid the swarms, while the individual members devour one another until only the strongest hatchlings are left alive to grow to maturity.
