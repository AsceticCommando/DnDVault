*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 288*  

The white arctic foxes of Icewind Dale live in burrows and are acclimated to cold weather. They prowl the outskirts of Ten-Towns and nearby forests for food, hunting hares or stealing fish. These timid creatures avoid contact with humanoids, but they are sometimes used as mounts by [chwingas](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-toa.md).
