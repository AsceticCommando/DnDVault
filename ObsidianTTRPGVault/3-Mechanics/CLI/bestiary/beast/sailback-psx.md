## Scales, Spikes, and Hammers

Sailbacks are predators that lurk in lakes and rivers to ambush unwary prey. Their statistics are equivalent to those of the [giant crocodile](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile-xmm.md) in the "Monster Manual".

## Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs are the dominant form of animal life in Ixalan—the absolute rulers of the coastal lands held by the Sun Empire, and a force to be reckoned with in the interior jungles. A number of dinosaurs appear in the "Monster Manual", with even more to be found in "Volo's Guide to Monsters", making that a particularly worthwhile resource for an Ixalan campaign. (Many of the dinosaurs in "Volo's Guide" also appear in Tomb of Annihilation.)
