> When it comes to infiltrating giant steadings, I must admit that spotted lions are in some ways preferable to, say, dire wolves or cave bears. Namely, if they're well fed, they're more likely to stretch and yawn than they are to raise an alarm when they spot you.

Roughly twice the size of a common lion, a spotted lion has a dusky coat and mane, both speckled with charcoal-colored spots. Spotted lions gather in prides to hunt enormous prey ranging from giant elk to mammoths. Stone and cloud giants often keep these massive beasts as pets and hunting companions.
