# [Swarm of Ravenous Insects](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-ravenous-insects-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 271*  

Ravenous insect swarms rapidly overwhelm larger creatures. Those slain by these swarms are consumed swiftly and entirely.

## Swarms of Insects

*Flesh-Eating Parasites*

Few fates are more gruesome than falling victim to the parasitic or skeletonizing insect swarms that lurk in haunted sites and cursed dungeons.
