## Arboreal Foes

The arboreal kavu bred by the Kelfae are capable of climbing sheer surfaces at any angle, and of charging at astonishing speed at ground level. Kelfae warriors ride a large breed of kavu predators, using a series of cloth slings as safety restraints while sitting or dangling from the creature's back. The nimble and acrobatic Kelfae kavu riders are called arborealists.

## Kavu

Kavu are reptilian creatures that are either very ancient or a relatively recent creation on Dominaria. Either awakening from a millennia-long hibernation or springing fully formed into being, they emerged from the ground to defend against the Phyrexian Invasion. The Llanowar elves now breed the kavu to fill a variety of roles, believing that these creatures were the goddess Gaea's means of intervening in Dominaria's defense. The close relationship between elves and kavu is a constant reminder of Gaea's beneficence. Every Kelfae bonds with an arboreal kavu companion, and some Kelfae and Basiphem warriors ride them into battle.
