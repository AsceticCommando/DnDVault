# [Swarm of Piranhas](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-piranhas-psx.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Ixalan p. 40*  

The waters of the Great River and all its tributaries are home to fish that serve as one of the most important food sources for other animals in the forest. These include large predatory fish, as well as churning swarms of small biting fish such as piranhas.
