      \ conditions, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from\

    "name": "Etherealness"
  - "desc": "One creature that the geist can see within 5 feet of it must succeed\
      \ on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the geist; the geist then\
      \ disappears, and the target is [incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ and loses control of its body. The geist now controls the body but doesn't\
      \ deprive the target of awareness. The geist can't be targeted by any attack,\
      \ spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment,\
      \ Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ and [frightened](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It otherwise\
      \ uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's\
      \ knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the\
      \ body drops to 0 hit points, the geist ends it as a bonus action, or the geist\
      \ is turned or forced out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good-xphb.md)\
      \ spell. When the possession ends, the geist reappears in an unoccupied space\
      \ within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this geist's Possession\
      \ for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession\
      \ ends. The geist can instead target the corpse of a creature, effectively using\
      \ its own life force to animate the corpse as a zombie. The animated corpse\
      \ uses zombie statistics and returns to death if the geist ends the possession."
