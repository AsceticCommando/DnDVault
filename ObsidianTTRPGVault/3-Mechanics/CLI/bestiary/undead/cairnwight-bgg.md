# [Cairnwight](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/cairnwight-bgg.md)
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 122*  

Stone giants believe the god Skoraeus Stonebones inspires artists to create their finest stone carvings. Sometimes a giant pursues this divine inspiration to the exclusion of all other tasks, retreating into a spacious cavern and blocking out all distractions. Creating a masterwork can become such a driving obsession that death can't stop it: a giant who dies while creating art might rise as a cairnwight and continue the work. Once the artwork is completed, the cairnwight remains as its undying guardian.

A cairnwight looks much like an emaciated stone giant. Its form is caked with lichens and mineral deposits, which help it blend with its cavern tomb. Should a creature attempt to interfere with the completion of the cairnwight's project, damage the art, or steal from the cairnwight, the giant petrifies the creature, places the resulting statue outside as a warning, then reseals its cavern vault.
