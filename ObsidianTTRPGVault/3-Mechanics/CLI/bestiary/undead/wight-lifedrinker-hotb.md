# [Wight Lifedrinker](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wight-lifedrinker-hotb.md)
*Source: Heroes of the Borderlands p. 19*  

Wights are the withered corpses of relentless warriors whose wickedness sustains them beyond death. After dying and returning from the grave, a wight continues its villainous ways, but it is now driven by a hunger for life. A wight drains living essence through its attacks.
