## Mind Drinker Vampire

When vampires join House Dimir, they can learn to siphon mental energy and memories along with the blood of their victims. They also study the magic favored by Dimir mind mages, giving them a powerful combination of abilities ideal for espionage and infiltration.

### Szadek's Heirs

The founder of House Dimir, Szadek, was the first of the so-called mind drinkers. His secrets are passed on only to other members of his guild, and mind drinkers who leave House Dimir become enemies of the guild-the only exceptions to a rule that prohibits mind drinkers from feeding on others of their kind.

### Cell Leaders

Thanks to their particular gifts, mind drinkers are often placed as leaders of small cells of covert Dimir operatives. They rarely trust their own agents, though, and often follow their cell members to make sure those members carry out missions as ordered. The most suspicious vampires might even siphon thoughts from their subordinates to detect any hint of betrayal.

## Vampires

Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.

The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Monster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood that sustains their undead existence.
