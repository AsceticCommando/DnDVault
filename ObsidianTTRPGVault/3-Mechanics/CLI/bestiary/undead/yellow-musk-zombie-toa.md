# [Yellow Musk Zombie](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/yellow-musk-zombie-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 237*  

A Medium humanoid transformed into a yellow musk zombie uses the stat block presented in this section. A Small humanoid transformed into a yellow musk zombie becomes a Small undead with `dice:6d6+6|noform|noparens|avg|text(27)` (`6d6 + 6`) hit points, but otherwise has the same statistics.

A yellow musk creeper is an unholy vine whose flowers resemble an orchid's. Bright yellow with splashes of purple, these flowers expel a musk that attracts prey. A yellow musk creeper clings to walls, pillars, gravestones, door frames, or statuary in shadowy locations, remaining motionless until it strikes.
