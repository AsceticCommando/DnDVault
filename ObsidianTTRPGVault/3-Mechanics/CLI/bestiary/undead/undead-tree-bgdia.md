      \ option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the tree. The tree remains animate\
      \ for 1 day or until it dies; until the tree dies or is more than 120 feet from\
      \ the tree; or until the tree takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate\
      \ tree. The tree then takes root if possible."
