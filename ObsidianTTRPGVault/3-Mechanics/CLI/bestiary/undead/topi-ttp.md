# [Topi](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/topi-ttp.md)
*Source: The Tortle Package p. 22*  

Topis are similar to zombies. Before a topi is animated, its corpse is shrunk until it stands only 2 feet tall, and its heart is cut out and replaced with a leather bag that contains a live poisonous snake. The snake requires neither air nor sustenance, and it magically renders the topi's claws venomous. When a topi dies, the snake inside it dies too. The process of creating a topi is known only to a handful of evil priests and necromancers.

Topis are more difficult to turn than ordinary zombies, and their spongy bodies make them resistant to bludgeoning.

## Undead Traits

A topi doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
