# [Vampire Warden](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire-warden-abh.md)
*Source: Astarion's Book of Hungers p. 20*  

*Stone-Skinned, Blood-Drinking Guardian*

Vampires need trusted guards for their lairs, minions, and treasures. After all, vampire familiars don't live for long and are inattentive while sleeping or simpering. Monstrous servants are often too unpredictable or simply unreliable. To keep their lairs safe, some vampires create more durable spawn to serve as watchful guardians. These vampire wardens appear to have the same pallid flesh as most vampires but, through sheer force of will, can shrug off blows that might fell others. When most vampires would be destroyed, a warden turns to stone, heals itself, and is ready for service once again.
