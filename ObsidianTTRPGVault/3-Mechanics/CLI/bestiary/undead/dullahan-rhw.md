*Source: RHW p. 244*  

*Vengeful Headless Hunter*

Headless, undying warriors, dullahans arise from decapitated villains and murderously seek to recover their missing heads. In their endless hunts, they terrorize sites relevant to their crimes or near where they died, beheading anyone they believe responsible (or connected to those responsible) for their deaths. Aside from their lethal blades, dullahans terrorize foes with their terrifying wails and by throwing the flame-wreathed skulls of past victims. Many pursue their victims astride undead or fiendish steeds.
