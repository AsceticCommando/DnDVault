## Blood Drinker Vampire

Plenty of blood drinkers haunt Ravnica's alleys and sewers, preying on those who are foolish enough to leave the relative safety of the crowds.

### Orzhov Vampires

Vampires thrive in the Orzhov Syndicate, where they can collect tithes and payments from their debtors in the form of blood. Their undead nature gives them the same immortality enjoyed by the oligarch spirits, but they remain capable of experiencing all the delights of their corporeal forms. In contrast to Orzhov spirits, they also retain their personalities, which are almost uniformly cruel.

### Blood Bond

Consuming a creature's blood creates a sort of empathic bond that allows the blood drinker vampire to exert some magical influence over its victim.

## Vampires

Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.

The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Monster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood that sustains their undead existence.
