# [Death's Head](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/deaths-head-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 242*  

The most common type of death's head arises from a person or animal, perhaps the victim of an unjust execution or a headhunting terror such as a dullahan. Flying and biting, a death's head harries its victims until destroyed.

## Death's Heads

*Flying Undead Heads*

Death's heads are disembodied, flying heads reanimated by wicked magic. These hateful heads vary in description and state of decay, with some possessing supernatural powers related to the beings they once were. Roll twice on or choose results from the Death's Head Features table to inspire the features of a death's head.
