# [Vampire Mind Flayer](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire-mind-flayer-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 276*  

Vampire mind flayers originate from the alien domain of Bluetspur (see " Other Domains of Dread "). In seeking a cure for their degenerating elder brain, the illithids of that realm tried radical experiments. The results were mind flayer tadpoles infected with vampirism. These terrors developed into mature mind flayers capable of harvesting psychic sustenance from sapient minds. After feeding on psionic energies, vampire mind flayers return to Bluetspur and are reabsorbed by the elder brain, releasing stolen psionic essences amid a hormone brine.

Vampire mind flayers are bestial creatures that lack control over their psychic abilities. Rather than focused mind blasts, they unleash waves of nauseating, mentally disruptive sensations. They use their viciously barbed tentacles to drain their victims' mental energy. Mind flayers loathe vampire mind flayers and view them as abominations. Nevertheless, they employ their warped brethren in desperate pursuits, such as preserving the elder brain of Bluetspur.

*Monstrous Life Drinkers*

Horrific varieties of blood-drinking vampires spread their wickedness across the Domains of Dread.
