# [Skeletal Alchemist](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeletal-alchemist-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 253*  

This undead retains enough of its former self to continue its alchemical work, often on behalf of necromancers or other sinister patrons. It toils in a dark laboratory (such as the one found in The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh), often falling dormant for long periods of time.
