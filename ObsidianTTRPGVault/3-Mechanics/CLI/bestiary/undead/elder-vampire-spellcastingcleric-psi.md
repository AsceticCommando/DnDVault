      \ at least 1 hit point. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from [holy\

      \ maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the\

  - "desc": "The vampire obscures its form with mind-affecting magic that makes others\
      \ perceive it as a beautiful human of the same size and shape. The illusion\
      \ ends if the vampire takes a bonus action to end it or if the vampire dies.\
      \ A creature that can see the vampire can take an action to visually inspect\
      \ it, ending the mental effect on itself and seeing the vampire's true form\
      \ with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception))\
