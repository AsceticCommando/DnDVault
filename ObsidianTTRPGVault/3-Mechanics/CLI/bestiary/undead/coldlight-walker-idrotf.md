# [Coldlight Walker](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/coldlight-walker-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 284*  

Some humanoids who died from extreme cold but whose spirits languish in the mortal world become coldlight walkers, burning with frigid fury at the meaninglessness of life. Their frostbitten corpses emit a spectral light so intense that mortal eyes can barely stand to look at them. They typically wear the clothing in which they died.

## God-Spawned Horrors

Gods that personify winter create coldlight walkers as embodiments of winter's wrath. These hateful spirits that were denied passage to the afterlife are preserved in their current forms to remind the living how fragile life can be.

When a coldlight walker dies, its light goes out, leaving behind a frozen, inanimate corpse that can never be raised from the dead.
