*Disembodied, Manipulative Mastermind*

A brain in a jar is the gray matter of one who cheated death through magic or strange surgeries. It now forces its will on those around it.

Some brains in jars are the result of strange experiments, bizarre punishments, or the aberrant preservation methods of creatures and mi-go. A brain in a jar's container might be an alien contraption, ostentatious glassware, or a mundane canister.
