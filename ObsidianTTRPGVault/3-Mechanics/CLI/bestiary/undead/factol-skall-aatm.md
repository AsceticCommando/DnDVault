# [Factol Skall](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/factol-skall-aatm.md)
*Source: Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary*  

Skall is the current factol of the Heralds of Dust and the only leader the faction has ever had. A popular Duster legend holds that other than the Lady of Pain herself, Skall is Sigil's oldest resident, the first creature to live and die in the City of Doors. The Heralds of Dust idolize their ageless factol, whose stoic visage has become the faction's emblem. Skall can usually be found examining his orrery of souls (detailed in *Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary*).

After eons of existence, Skall is in an advanced state of deterioration. Once a spry lich with a wrinkled frame, he now drifts listlessly through the Mortuary's forlorn halls, rasping to himself. Skall appears as little more than a floating, disembodied head and two hands, his tattered cloak fluttering behind them. Notorious among the factols of Sigil but rarely seen in the flesh, Skall often delegates his bureaucratic responsibilities to Undead proxies or—on rare occasions—appears as an illusory duplicate. Subtle social cues are lost on the factol, whose eternal nature has eroded any memory of mortal life.

As a result of his decay, Skall's power has waned considerably, but challenging him in combat is as much a death sentence as ever. Factol Skall imparts a lasting oblivion to his enemies. Caretaker, custodian, and grave keeper, the factol ushers allies and foes alike from this false existence toward the path to True Death.
