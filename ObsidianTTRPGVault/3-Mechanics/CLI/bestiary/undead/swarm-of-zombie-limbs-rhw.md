# [Swarm of Zombie Limbs](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/swarm-of-zombie-limbs-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 282*  

Dismemberment sometimes isn't enough to disable a zombie's undying rage. Swarms of zombie limbs reanimate from the slough of zombie flesh molters and surge on hapless monster hunters who mistakenly believed their work is done.

## Zombies

*Relentless Reanimated Corpses*

The zombies of Ravenloft come in many monstrous forms. These Undead horrors befoul and beleaguer any living thing in their way.
