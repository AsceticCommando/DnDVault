*Source: RHW p. 283*  

Necromancers who wish to sow as much toxic mayhem as possible often create zombie plague spreaders to do their dirty work for them.

## Zombies

*Relentless Reanimated Corpses*

The zombies of Ravenloft come in many monstrous forms. These Undead horrors befoul and beleaguer any living thing in their way.
