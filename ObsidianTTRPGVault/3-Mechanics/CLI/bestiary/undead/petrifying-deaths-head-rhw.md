# [Petrifying Death's Head](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/petrifying-deaths-head-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 243*  

A death's head animated from the head of a petrifying creature, like a medusa, retains the ability to temporarily petrify its victims.

## Death's Heads

*Flying Undead Heads*

Death's heads are disembodied, flying heads reanimated by wicked magic. These hateful heads vary in description and state of decay, with some possessing supernatural powers related to the beings they once were. Roll twice on or choose results from the Death's Head Features table to inspire the features of a death's head.
