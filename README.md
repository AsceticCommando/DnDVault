# THE WEFT — D&D Campaign Vault

> *The great Weft has existed in obliviousness to the gods and mortals that roamed inside its vastness, until now.*

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) campaign vault for **THE WEFT**, a multiverse D&D setting. Built on Josh Plunkett's [Obsidian TTRPG Tutorials](https://obsidianttrpgtutorials.com/) vault template, so every worldbuilding note is a structured, wikilinked, Dataview- and graph-ready entry rather than a loose document.

---

## The setting

THE WEFT (called **The Hang** by those who live in it) is a woven multiverse: countless parallel worlds strung side by side like cloth on a loom, held in tension by **six cosmic forces** — the Evocade, Tethyne, Sijill, Tehom, Nifling, and Raijin.

Worlds are threads. To be *cut* is to fall into the **Underdrop**; to be *kept* is to be filed in **the Anthology** — recorded, then quietly allowed to die. The campaign's central horror lives in the gap between those two fates.

The player characters are **Editions**: living copies smuggled out of the Anthology, archived duplicates of originals whose worlds were "saved." Each carries a *fidelity* rating that drifts over time. At the center of it all sits the betrayer-god **al-Kutbā**, who wears his archived twin **Dushara** as a mask.

The primary investigation arc is the **Peripeteia**, a two-session (~6–8 hour) module in which the party forces that mask off.

## Repository structure

This repo is the source of truth for the vault. The Obsidian vault itself lives under `ObsidianTTRPGVault/`:

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| `2-World/` | **All worldbuilding content** — the canonical setting notes (locations, people, groups, quests, species). |
| `1-DM Toolkit/` | GM-facing material, including the `THE WEFT/` source docs (`THE_WEFT_Peripeteia.docx` + companion knowledge tree). |
| `1-Party/`, `1-Session Journals/` | Party roster and play-session logs. |
| `3-Mechanics/` | Imported rules compendium (~15k files). **Not worldbuilding** — excluded from any world audit. |
| `z_Templates/`, `z_Assets/` | Note templates and image/asset store. |
| `0-Obsidian TTRPG Tutorial/` | The original template's tutorial notes. |

> ⚠️ The subfolder names under `2-World/` (`Galaxies`, `Hubs`, `Quests`, etc.) are **hard-coded into the note templates**. Renaming them silently breaks Templater/meta-bind generation. See `2-World/Important - Read Me.md`.

## Current world state

The `2-World` folder currently holds **25 authored WEFT notes** alongside the template's original "Test" placeholders. All authored notes have valid parent links — **no broken containment links and no orphans**.

    └── The Anagnorisis        (Quest)
```

### The Quest arc

A five-movement tragic structure, named for the parts of a Greek drama:

1. **The Prologos** — the setup, in the lost origin world.
2. **The Parodos** — arrival and the false rescue.
3. **The Peripeteia** — the reversal; the two-session investigation module and central hinge.
4. **The Anagnorisis** — the recognition.
5. **The Exodos** — the departure.

### The six cosmic forces

Modeled as `Group` notes with live `allies`/`enemies` standing blocks. Current alignments: the **Tehom** stands opposed to every other force; **Evocade–Raijin–Tethyne** and **Sijill–Nifling** form the two main blocs, with the Sijill and Tethyne locked as enemies.

## The knowledge-tree tool

The vault is audited with the **`dnd-worldtree`** skill (`build_knowledge_tree.py`), a read-only parser that reads *only* the YAML frontmatter of `2-World` notes — never the note bodies, which contain Templater/meta-bind code.

```bash
python3 build_knowledge_tree.py \
  --vault ObsidianTTRPGVault \
  --subdir 2-World \
  --out ./out
```

Requires `PyYAML`. It outputs:

- `knowledge_tree.md` — the containment tree, a category index, broken-link/orphan sections, and the relationship-edge list.
- `knowledge_graph.json` — nodes + containment edges + relationship edges + stats, for graph view or further analysis.

Point it at `2-World` only — never at `3-Mechanics/`.

---

## Authoring conventions

The vault's data model is what makes the graph, Dataview, and the worldtree tool all work. Each authored note follows these rules:

- **Category tag + container.** Every note carries exactly one `Category/<Type>` tag and a `MyContainer:` wikilink to its parent location. These two fields drive placement in the tree and graph.
- **Wikilink format.** Cross-references use the full path form: `[[2-World/<Folder>/<Name>.md|<Name>]]`.
- **YAML quoting.** Any frontmatter value containing a colon **must** be double-quoted (e.g. `questGiver: "[[2-World/People/al-Kutbā.md|al-Kutbā]]"`), or the frontmatter fails silently.
- **Frontmatter over body.** Keep frontmatter fully correct; don't hand-author the Templater/meta-bind UI machinery in note bodies — the create-note buttons generate that.
- **Canon vs. proposal.** Notes still awaiting ratification are flagged with a `> [!note] Proposed extension` callout so they stay visually distinct from established canon.
- **Extra relationship fields** (e.g. `allies`/`enemies` on Groups) are harmless — the graph and the worldtree tool pick them up automatically.

---

## Roadmap

- Flesh out the two thinly-sketched cosmic forces (the **Evocade** and the **Nifling**) to complete the cosmology layer.
- Decide whether to fill intermediate location tiers (Star System → Planet → Continent) between the Galaxy root and the Hub level.
- Author notes for the **Catastrophe** boss and the **Errata civil-war** content flagged in the campaign bible.
- Run a cleanup pass to remove the remaining `Test` placeholder notes from `2-World`.
